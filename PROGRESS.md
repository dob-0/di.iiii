## 2026-07-26 — Landing "Open Studio" un-hijacked from jam mode; CI audit gate unblocked; dev→main promoted

**Who:** Claude. User-reported bug: logged-out "Open Studio" on the landing
page dumped visitors into the stripped-down jam editor at
`/open/studio/projects/open-jam`. Cause: the Jul 21 open-jam work made the
open-space hub auto-forward into the jam project ("door, not a lobby",
`StudioHub.jsx`), and the landing CTAs already pointed at `/open/studio`.
Fix: `OPEN_STUDIO_HREF` (and nav "Studio") now use the hub's existing
`?browse=1` forward opt-out; "Step inside" keeps the plain door on purpose.
Regression tests lock both hrefs (`LandingPage.test.jsx`); known-fixes entry
added. Commit `6c795fce`.

The push's staging deploy then failed at CI's `npm audit --production
--audit-level=high` gate — new high-severity advisories against transitive
`sharp@0.34.5` (libvips CVEs, via `@gltf-transform/functions → ndarray-pixels`),
unrelated to the change. Fixed with a root `overrides` entry forcing
`sharp@^0.35.3` (matching serverXR's direct dep). Commit `bada1cbd`.
Two moderate react-router advisories remain (fix = breaking v7 upgrade,
deliberately not taken; they don't block the high-level gate).

Also resolved a local/origin `dev` divergence from concurrent sessions
(rebased the Jul 19 recap commit onto the Jul 21 open-jam commits — git
auto-merged CURRENT.md by concatenation; compressed back into PROGRESS.md
this session). Staging verified green (all CI jobs + headless Playwright
href check), then user asked to promote: `dev → main` at `bada1cbd`,
production deploy green, live-verified on di-studio.xyz (hrefs correct,
zero page errors). Production now carries the full open-jam feature set,
the landing fix, and the sharp override.

## 2026-07-21 (later) — minimal jam mode UI

- User feedback: the full Studio editor overwhelms QR newbies at `/open_jam`.
  Shipped **minimal jam mode** — same floating-window UI, auto-on at the
  open-jam project only: one Create window (file upload + 5 simple shapes,
  no lights/Drive/Commons/share/delete), no Scene/World/Share/Code/Projects
  windows, no Arrange/Hub/View-live chrome, mobile nav = Create only,
  QuickInsert uses the same reduced palette. "⚒ All tools" ⇄ "◱ Simple"
  toggle in the cluster (persisted per device, `di.studio.jamAllTools`).
- New `src/studio/utils/jamMode.js` (+ `JAM_PRIMITIVES` in `entityPalette.js`);
  prop-gating in `StudioControlCluster`/`LibraryPanel`/`StudioQuickInsert`;
  wiring in `StudioShell.jsx`. Tests: `StudioJamMode.test.jsx` (7 cases).
  Wiki article updated. lint/build/902 tests/wiki check all pass.
- Follow-up (user tested staging: "can't change text"): added `JamEditPanel` —
  jam mode's whole inspector. Desktop: floating Edit window auto-appears on
  selection; mobile: an "Edit" tab next to Create. Text content ("Your text"),
  appearance color, "✕ Remove" — all through the normal `updateComponent`
  patch pipeline, so "All tools" sees identical values. +4 tests (11 jam total).
- **Concurrent-session incident, again**: mid-work, `git status` showed fresh
  edits in `src/raw/`, `src/project/graph/`, `nodeRegistry` + a new
  `useDeviceEgress.js` — another live session in this same working tree (the
  parallel-agents pattern; their in-progress `FaderControl.jsx` briefly failed
  repo-wide lint). Followed the documented rule: staged/committed ONLY own
  files after diffing each, validated per-file lint + targeted tests + build,
  left their work untouched.
- Earlier today: `/open_jam` short link + jam welcome shipped to production
  (see below).

## 2026-07-21 — open-jam short link + minimal jam welcome

- Goal: a minimalist, QR-friendly way for non-technical people to join the
  communal jam and add their own visuals. Backend/auth already supported it
  (guests get an `editor` grant on the `open` space; `open-jam` uploads work) —
  the gap was purely UX/entry.
- Shipped (frontend only, landed on `dev` → staging):
  - **Short link `/open_jam`** — a QR-/flyer-sized alias resolving to the same
    editor state as `/open/studio/projects/open-jam`, no redirect (URL stays
    short). Added in `src/studio/utils/studioRouting.js`
    (`OPEN_JAM_ALIAS_SEGMENT`/`_SPACE_ID`/`_PROJECT_ID`); SPA fallback in
    `nginx.conf` already serves it. Regression test in `studioRouting.test.js`.
  - **Minimal jam welcome** — single-beat coach at `/open_jam` only
    ("Open Create to add your visual to the jam ✨" → "Nice! ✨ Add as many as
    you like" on first add, then fades). Shows once per device for everyone
    (guest or signed-in), separate from the guest walkthrough. `StudioCoachMarks.jsx`
    refactored into a hookless dispatcher + `GuestCoach`/`JamCoach`; helpers in
    `studioGuide.js` (`STUDIO_JAM_COACH_DONE_KEY`, `shouldShowJamCoach`,
    `markJamCoachDone`); flag wired from `StudioShell.jsx`
    (`document.projectMeta.id === 'open-jam'`). Tests in `StudioCoachMarks.test.jsx`.
  - Wiki updated (`wikiContent.js`, `guest-and-sandbox-modes` article).
- Validation (Node 22 via `brew node@22` — this Mac's default Node 25 breaks
  jsdom's localStorage, an env-only issue): lint clean, build passes, 794/794
  tests, wiki check passes.
- Not done: live click-through on staging (owed after the push's deploy
  settles); not promoted to `main`/production — user has only asked for `dev`.

## 2026-07-19 — live-verified vanity links + seed on staging, reorganized Admin UI

Ran the full validation suite on the previous sessions' unpushed/unverified
work (lint/build/887 tests/64 contract tests/docs checks — all clean, one
`syncRoutes.test.js` timeout confirmed flaky under parallel load, not a
real failure), then manually click-through tested on `staging.di-studio.xyz`
via the Chrome extension: `/wcc` + `/wcc/scene` (untouched, still correct),
a bogus vanity-link segment (hits `GET /api/resolve/...`, 404s, falls
through cleanly to the plain space — no crash), `/open/studio` (not
hijacked by the new 2-segment routing), and `/open/raw` (loads clean, no
console errors). Confirmed auth gating works both directions (blocked from
a space outside the guest session's scope, allowed into a public one).
**Not verified**: the admin slug-edit UI and `ProjectSwitcher`'s "Copy
link" button — this session only had guest/anonymous access, no owner
login, on staging or local dev.

User then flagged the admin/preferences area as "messy — target audience
and backend are mixed" and asked about adding role tiers (super-admin/
admin/etc). Audited first rather than guessing: the role model itself
(`guest < viewer < editor < admin` global rank + per-space grant list +
per-space owner, `serverXR/src/authAccess.js`) is reasonable as-is — the
actual mess is `AdminManageSection.jsx`'s space/project detail panels
mixing audience-facing controls (public link, public/private, publish,
main, guest entry) with backend/infra controls (permanent/temporary,
edit-lock, raw ids, embedded GitHub-sync internals) in one undifferentiated
button grid, plus `PreferencesPage.jsx`'s "Admin Console" bundling 7
unrelated debug/telemetry tabs alongside the 2 real access-control tabs
with no visual distinction. Presented two options — reorganize-only vs.
add real owner/platform-admin tiering — user picked reorganize-only.

Shipped (`df8ac3c8`, pushed): `AdminManageSection.jsx`'s space/project
detail panels split into "Audience & publishing" vs "Storage & sync" /
"Details"; `PreferencesPage.jsx`'s `SectionNav` now groups Manage/Open
Call under an "admin" label separately from the 7 debug tabs under
"diagnostics". No schema/role/route changes — pure UI reorg. Lint clean,
build clean, 887/887 tests green. **Not yet visually confirmed** — same
no-admin-login gap as above; user was about to log in and check when this
recap was written.

## 2026-07-19 — live-verified `src/raw/`, found + fixed a real World-nesting bug

Did the manual live click-through of `/open/raw` that the previous two
sessions had shipped but never actually run (browser extension wasn't
connected until this session). Found the free-nesting/active-marker/code-
panel work all genuinely works as designed — verified by placing all 49
registered node types in one project (zero crashes, zero console errors)
and by diffing raw `parentId` values from `/api/projects/:id/document`
rather than trusting the UI.

That same API-diffing turned up a real bug the UI was actively lying
about: nesting anything **inside** a `universe.world` node — the entire
point of the previous sessions' redesign — silently landed the new node
as a **sibling** of World instead of its child, at any depth. I initially
reported this as working (trusted a UI element that looked like scope
navigation but wasn't); only caught by fetching the live document and
reading `parentId` directly. Root cause: `universe.world` (and every
other `panel-2d`-render type — Text/Image/Browser/stream panels) is
deliberately excluded from the graph canvas's card list, which was the
*only* thing wired to the scope-navigation handler — so there was no
reachable way to enter such a node's own scope at all. Fixed by adding an
`Enter ›` button to `DesktopWindow.jsx`'s per-node window header, wired to
the pre-existing `handleEnterNode` (which already handled `universe.world`
correctly — it just had no caller). Verified live at 1 and 4 levels of
nesting: children now get the correct `parentId` and render in the 3D
viewport (a cube/sphere genuinely appears on the grid). Full writeup:
`docs/ai/known-fixes.md` (last row).

**Separately confirmed and NOT yet fixed**: opening a nested World's live
3D viewport while an ancestor scope's World viewport is also mounted can
trigger `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost.` and freeze the tab's paint
pipeline (data survives — confirmed via reload — only the render/compositor
hangs). Reproduced twice in independent tabs. Likely simultaneous WebGL
context exhaustion (browsers cap concurrent contexts, ~16). Not touched
this session — flagged for whoever picks up World-viewport work next.

Committed `40d96c0d` (code + tests, 4 new tests, 891/891 suite green,
lint clean) + docs commit `a6f4b20d`. Pushed to `origin/dev`.

## 2026-07-19 — vanity space/project links + a real concurrent-edit incident

Shipped clean public links: spaces/projects get a `slug` independently
renameable from their immutable id, enabling `/wcc/artistplace`-style short
links alongside the existing `/p/{id}` and `/studio/projects/{id}` forms
(both kept forever, nothing replaced). Server: `spaces.slug`/`projects.slug`
columns, `PATCH` validation (reserved words, 409 on collision), new
`GET /api/resolve/:space/:project`. Client: `getAppLocationState` classifies
the bare two-segment shape, `SlugProjectRoute` resolves it and falls back to
a plain space route on a miss. Admin gets an "Edit public link" action;
`ProjectSwitcher` gets one-click "Copy link". Full proposal (custom domains
and in-app space export still draft-only): `docs/architecture/
SPEC_space_urls_and_portability.md`. Committed `26452eb3`.

**Real incident, now resolved**: this repo runs multiple concurrent Claude
sessions sharing the same on-disk working tree (see `docs/ai/parallel-
agents.md`). Editing `src/RootApp.jsx` landed a stray import from another
session's in-progress, uncommitted `src/raw/` lane — `src/RootApp.jsx` on
disk already had their edits when mine were applied, and the whole file got
committed together, breaking the pushed build (`f7306204` attempted a fix
by stripping the import; that raced with the other session's own fix,
`9c70e534`, which committed the real `src/raw/` files instead — `d908bcd3`
reverted `f7306204` once the actual fix was confirmed). Net effect after
all three commits: both features are intact, correctly wired, and verified
live. **Lesson for next session**: when a shared file was very likely
touched by someone else recently (long-running repo, multiple active
sessions), diff the actual staged change before committing — don't assume
"what's on disk when I `git add` this file" is only your own edit.

## 2026-07-19 — kill node-type singletons, universal code panel; committed `fe30ea53`, pushed

The `src/raw/` lane itself (fork of Beta, hierarchy-as-connection active
markers) was committed separately by a concurrent session (`9c70e534`,
after `26452eb3` shipped RootApp's seed import without the untracked
`src/raw/` directory — a real CI-breaking near-miss, now fixed). This
session's own commit (`fe30ea53`) covers the schema/registry/Beta/docs
side of the same work — the two commits together are the full picture.

User wanted free-form node nesting ("build like lego") instead of the
one-per-scope restriction a same-day-earlier session had just added a
warning for. Went through a deep multi-tool research pass (TouchDesigner,
Notch, Kantan Mapper, Houdini, Blender, Nuke, Unreal Blueprints, vvvv,
Cables.gl, Max/MSP, VCV Rack, Resolume, QLab, Ableton, Hydra) before landing
on a concrete plan — full writeup: `/home/nooo/.claude/plans/luminous-bouncing-otter.md`.
Shipped (lint/build/887 tests green throughout):

1. **Removed the singleton system entirely** — `SINGLETON_TYPE_IDS`/
   `SCOPE_SINGLETON_TYPE_IDS`/`getSingletonDedupKey` deleted from both
   `src/shared/projectSchema.js` and `shared/projectSchema.cjs` (not left
   unused — actually gone). Stripped `singleton:true` from the 6 affected
   `nodeRegistry.js` types. Removed Beta's same-day blocked-create warning
   (`getPaletteBlockReason`, `NodePalette.jsx`'s `getBlockReason` prop/CSS).
2. **New lane `src/raw/`** — full fork of `src/beta/` (first lane-forked-
   from-another-lane in the project; see `PROJECT_SURFACES.md`'s "On forking
   a new lane from Beta"), routed at `/open/raw`, wired into `RootApp.jsx`.
   Own localStorage namespace (`dii.seed.*`). Fixed one opportunistic bug
   while forking: edges are now scope-filtered before rendering.
3. **Hierarchy-as-connection active markers** (Kantan Mapper pattern) — new
   generic `workspaceState.activeNodeIdByTypeScope` map (keyed
   `typeId::scopeId`) for World/Light/Background/Grid, alongside the
   pre-existing `liveWorldNodeIdByScope`. Small ● toggle on `seed`'s graph
   node cards. Beta itself keeps its simpler `.find()`-first-match lookup.
4. **Universal code panel** — every node type (not just `node.null`) gets an
   inert "Code" inspector section, `values.__code` (distinct reserved key).
   No execution anywhere — storage/display only, deliberately out of scope.
5. Added `authoringOnly: true` (cosmetic palette tag) to the ~24 node types
   that don't compute/render anything real yet.

Design detail + explicitly-deferred Phase 2 (boundary In/Out nodes, a
closed-outer-panel/custom-parameter side-channel, Studio-as-a-brick, a
separate performance-safe surface): plan file above,
`docs/architecture/RECURSIVE_NODE_CORE.md` ("Nesting"/"The `seed` lane"),
`docs/ai/known-fixes.md` (last row). Committed (`fe30ea53`) and pushed
(`c0d33af5` on top, docs-only). Not yet manually click-verified live
(hit a real routing regression during the first attempt — a concurrent
session's `f7306204` had dropped the seed import from `RootApp.jsx`,
already reverted by `d908bcd3` before this — see "Last commit" above
before assuming that's still broken). Next: push (when asked) + a live
click-through of `/open/raw`.

## 2026-07-19 — audience/promotion/licensing

- **License**: repo now AGPL-3.0 (`LICENSE` + package.json
  `"license": "AGPL-3.0-only"`) — makes the landing's "Open source"
  claim true. Direction user-confirmed: open like a library, revenue
  from services around it, never from closing the code.
- **Promotion kit**: `docs/promo/` — PLAN.md (ranked audiences, phased
  rollout), SUSTAINABILITY.md (AGPL code + CC-BY asset commons +
  4 revenue lanes; Blender-fund model verified), drafts/ (Notations #2
  post, Show HN, Three.js forum, Reddit, stakeholder mail template +
  verified festival/grant list). 101-agent deep-research verified the
  festival/funding claims 3-0; community-launch norms did NOT survive
  verification — re-check forum rules manually before posting.
- **Near-term calendar**: EMAP call opens 3 Sep 2026 (deadline 6 Nov);
  Horizon HERITAGE deadline 23 Sep 2026 (needs heritage-institution
  consortium partner); Jan 2027: Prix Ars Electronica + ECHOES call 3;
  FIVARS next cycle = best WebXR fit. Submit works, not the platform.
- Wiki: new "License & openness" article. Golden rule added:
  usage-limit sizing + never-brick checkpoint workflow
  (docs/ai/golden_rules.md, Agent Behavior Rules).
- **Later same session**: pushed to dev + staging live-verified (landing/
  wiki/wcc/beyond-form, zero JS errors); unbricked CI by committing the
  missing `src/raw/` lane (`9c70e534`); golden rule split into two
  (budget sizing vs same-session perk capture, `44d12e1b`); docs IA fix —
  one canonical lane map in README/CURRENT.md/AGENTS.md (`7753699c`);
  new **Producer role** (`docs/ai/roles/producer.md`, `6892b005`) —
  default first hat: classify user messages, park impulsive ideas
  verbatim+translated in `docs/ai/INBOX.md`, never mix into running work.
  Inbox has its first real entry: **sound-in-spaces** (parked). Results
  artifact page published (private) for the user.
- **Owed by user**: 60–90s demo recording; fill warm-contact names in
  drafts/stakeholders.md; approve every outbound post/mail (Notations #2
  draft ready for Jul 20); say when to promote dev → main (license goes
  live on prod only then).
- **Nothing was posted or mailed. Production untouched.**

## 2026-07-18 — Studio wrong-space bug fix + hardening batch 1+2

- Real user-reported bug: opening a project in Studio via a direct/
  bookmarked link (no space segment in the URL, e.g. from admin's
  "Open in Studio") silently landed in the `main` space instead of the
  project's real space — everything but the project document itself
  (assets, publish state, back-to-hub link) was wrong. Root cause:
  `getStudioLocationState` (`src/studio/utils/studioRouting.js`)
  hardcoded `spaceId: defaultSpaceId` for space-less URLs instead of
  leaving it unset, pre-empting `StudioEditor`'s own fallback to
  `document.projectMeta.spaceId`. Fixed + admin's two "Open in Studio"
  buttons (`AdminManageSection.jsx`) switched from an async `space`
  lookup (`space?.id`, could resolve null/stale) to `project.spaceId`
  (DB-sourced, travels with the project row). Regression tests added;
  known-fixes.md updated. Pushed to `dev`, staging verified.
- User then asked for a "full audit + hardening plan" covering this bug
  class, general security, and AI-agent stale-fact citation (caught the
  agent citing an old cPanel deploy workflow and a wrong Ollama model
  name in the same session). Planned via EnterPlanMode, approved, shipped
  in two batches (not yet pushed — local commits `1a56e9a7`, `e374d70f`):
  - **Batch 1**: `config.js` now hard-fails boot in production if
    `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` falls back to an API token instead of only
    warning; CI + Dependabot gained `npm audit` coverage (root +
    serverXR); new `scripts/check-fallback-patterns.mjs` (CI-gated)
    greps `serverXR/src` for the "silent hardcoded fallback" bug-class
    shape; `known-fixes.md` got a bug-class header naming all 4 known
    instances; `golden_rules.md`/`agent-operating-contract.md` gained a
    "verify infra/deploy/tool facts before citing" rule.
  - **Batch 2**: new `fallbackContracts.test.js` (server-side analog of
    the spaceId bug, wired into `test:server-contracts`) +
    `authAccess.test.js` cases locking in null/undefined-spaces-means-
    unrestricted semantics; `docs:ai:check`'s rot-scan extended to
    `docs/deploy/*.md` for stale legacy-workflow-name citations — running
    it for real found and fixed two genuinely stale citations beyond the
    known allowlist candidates (`.claude/agents/infra.md` still called
    the cPanel workflow "Current deploy"; `deploy/AGENTS.md` still
    described the VPS path as unconfigured/additive when it's been live
    primary since 2026-07-15).
  - User's own global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (outside this repo) also had
    the same stale cPanel deploy claim — fixed on request.
  - Full plan: `/home/nooo/.claude/plans/stateless-greeting-bengio.md`.
    Deferred items (not started): recover/re-list the ~23 untriaged audit
    findings, decide whether to test-gate `deploy-space-code.yml`, rotate
    the stale GitHub App key, a speculative periodic memory-self-audit.

## 2026-07-16 → 2026-07-17 — compressed recaps (moved from CURRENT.md; no fuller PROGRESS entries exist)

- **2026-07-17 cont'd**: landing "Enter Space" reuses the existing "Main"
  space concept (`defaultSpaceId`) rather than a new config field; a real
  Walk/Fly UX bug fixed (mislabeled exit button, not a broken mechanism);
  "Made with di.iiii" badge restyled to work on any theme.
- **2026-07-17, perf audit**: 12 fixes (build chunking, code-splitting,
  caching, query paths, render loops) shipped to prod; two live bugs found
  during manual verification and fixed (`/data/spaces` root-owned →
  EACCES, and a pre-existing mouse-look bug from a stale `playerRef`
  reassignment, `git log -L`-blamed to commit `a79c689c`).
- **2026-07-17, multi-world graphs**: `world.light`/`background`/`grid`/
  `universe.world` moved to per-scope dedup, `BetaViewport.jsx` scoped
  rendering, `workspaceState.liveWorldNodeIdByScope` live-pointer + "●"
  toggle, Studio's read-only `StudioWorldSurface.jsx` render pane
  (dev-only "W" split) — this is the multi-world/singleton system this
  session's node-graph rework builds on top of and then removes.
- **2026-07-17, Beta audit → Studio graph pane**: fixed a window-clipping
  CSS bug, extracted the node-graph engine into `src/project/graph/`,
  added Studio's first read-only graph pane (dev-only "N" split), fixed a
  Node-0-deletion safety bug.
- **2026-07-16, full repo audit**: fixed path-traversal/auth-scope bug in
  `syncRoutes.js`, a lost-update race on concurrent doc writes, confirmed
  nightly VPS backups already existed. ~23 lower findings still open, see
  `docs/ai/known-fixes.md`.
- **Earlier**: deploy pipeline made real (staging+prod on VPS/Docker/Caddy),
  OAuth sign-in bug fixed (state signed per-request, not once at startup).

## 2026-07-12 — Invite links: self-serve sharing without the admin (audit slice 6)

**Who:** Claude. Session opened with a status pass (both envs smoke-green), then
user picked the last unbuilt audit slice: owner-minted invite links. Design
locked with the user first: guests may redeem; one-button UI (no management
surface yet — server keeps list/revoke endpoints).

- `space_invites` table + `inviteStore.js`, a sibling of `syncKeyStore.js`:
  `dii_invite_<id>.<secret>`, sha256-at-rest, constant-time compare, fail-closed
  resolve, 7-day default TTL, `use_count`/`last_used_at` bumped only on redeem.
- Routes: `POST/GET/DELETE /api/spaces/:spaceId/invites` behind the existing
  `requireSpaceOwnerOrAdmin` (rate-limited mint) — scope membership is NOT
  ownership, so invited people can't mint invites (no escalation). Redeem:
  `POST /api/invites/redeem` — registered users go through
  `grantSpaceToSessionUser` (DB + cookie re-mint); guests get a cookie-only
  re-mint (30d); token-login sessions get the cookie path too. Invalid /
  expired / revoked are indistinguishable 404s.
- SpaceHub card: Invite button (owner-only, existing `.ssh-card-btn`) mints and
  copies `<origin>/<space>/studio?invite=<token>` — the studio path so the gate
  always runs, even for public spaces.
- AuthGate: `?invite=` auto-redeems when out of scope, then refreshes the
  session and strips the param; pending invite wins over the public-view
  redirect; failure adds one line to the access-restricted screen.
- Tests: 3 inviteStore unit tests (tamper/revoke/expiry/usage) + 1 end-to-end
  HTTP contract (mint gate, guest redeem, no-escalation, revoke). Wiki article
  `invite-links` added + highlighted.
- Validation: lint, build, 575 unit, 47 contracts, wiki + docs checks — green.
- Branch `feat/invite-links`; sync-key manage 403 copy generalized ("manage
  sharing for this space").

---

## 2026-07-11 — Sandbox archive + revive: permanent sandboxes never pile up

**Who:** Claude. User asked whether many future users would re-flood the studio
with sandboxes; answer was "only permanent account sandboxes grow unbounded" —
user chose the archive + revive option to close that path (PR #42, merged to dev).

- `archiveIdleAccountSandboxes` (spaceStore): account sandboxes idle past
  `ACCOUNT_SANDBOX_TTL_MS` (default 180d) snapshot their scene then delete;
  empty ones delete without a snapshot; sandboxes holding Studio projects are
  never archived (snapshots capture only the scene).
- `ensureOwnSandbox` revives: a returning owner's fresh sandbox is restored
  from its latest snapshot (sceneVersion set to 1) — the room comes back.
- Runs on the daily boot interval and inside `POST /api/admin/sandboxes/purge`
  (response now `{ ok, removed, archived }`; hub Sweep button unchanged).
- Tests: 2 store unit tests + 1 HTTP contract (build → archive → 404 → owner
  GET restores scene). Wiki article updated with the six-month promise.
- Validation: lint, build, 570 unit, 46 contracts, wiki check — all green.

---

## 2026-07-10 (night) — Guest journey rethink: three-place space model shipped

**Who:** Claude. User: "still messy… we need one sandbox per user, one open space
to collab, and the [owned spaces] for users." Storyboard agreed first (all four
decisions D1–D4 approved), then built as 4 slices:
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d0267562-fa6d-4fa7-9c2f-be3d4e094778

### The model — three places, that's all

**Open Space** (one communal `open` space, everyone edits, ensured at boot) ·
**Your sandbox** (exactly one per identity, guests throwaway / accounts permanent) ·
**Your spaces** (owned, unchanged). Landing's primary CTA is now the door.

### Shipped (all merged to dev, tests + wiki + known-fixes each)

- **PR #38** server model — communal grant in `canAccessSpace` (no cookie re-mints),
  deterministic `getOwnSandboxSpaceId`, admin `sandboxSummary` + purge endpoint,
  daily open-space snapshot + `restore-snapshot` route. Watch out: `GUEST_SPACES=*`
  in a `.env.local` no longer means "all spaces" for guests — it falls through to
  the default open space.
- **PR #39** hub three shelves (Open Space / Your sandbox / Your spaces); admin sees
  sandboxes as one collapsed row with Sweep expired; sandbox cards hide raw ids.
- **PR #40** "Step inside" landing CTA → `/open/studio` → auto-forward into the
  boot-ensured shared `open-jam` project (`?browse=1` keeps the hub list). Guest
  first-run: `StudioCoachMarks` action-completed pills (select → add → share)
  replace the auto-opening help dialog (help stays behind `?`).
- **PR #41** keep the room — at sign-in (OAuth or token), the old guest cookie is
  still on the request; `promoteGuestSandbox` + `spaceStore.moveSpace` re-home the
  guest's whole sandbox onto the account's sandbox id. Never clobbers account work.
  Toast: "Signed in — your sandbox came with you."

### Open

- Staging verify: open space + open-jam exist after deploy; check `globalSpaceId`
  in staging/prod config (a set value repoints the commons — null → default `open`).
- Real-device click-through still owed for this + the previous session's slices.
- Slice 6 of the old audit (invite links) still designed-not-built.
- Prod promotion on user's word.

**Who:** Claude (audit fan-out: 5 parallel code-sweep agents; then single-agent fixes).
Session goal: "guest UX isn't intuitive → analyze every user type, then fix one by one."

### Audit

Mapped guest, registered creator, public viewer, WCC visitor, collaborator, mobile,
and admin journeys file-by-file. Report (journeys, ranked findings, 5 cross-cutting
patterns, 7-slice roadmap): https://claude.ai/code/artifact/a739fd54-d04c-4cad-a18e-707470c36b0a
Headlines: split-brain publish (says "Published", space stays private); public viewer
had zero path to creating; Studio had zero onboarding (hotkey table only); no
self-serve sharing; Studio ignored its own isMobile; "Settings" was an admin dead end.

### Shipped (all merged to dev, each with regression tests + wiki + known-fixes)

- **PR #32** publish intent unified — visibility disclosed + one-click Make public
  in Share window and SpaceHub card; truthful messages; no silent flips.
- **PR #33** `MadeWithBadge` view→create affordance on every public surface.
- **PR #34** `StudioHelpDialog` visual help (4 CSS-diagram guides + Shortcuts tab);
  guest first-run auto-open once per browser.
- **PR #35** guest "Keep this work" card in Share (OAuth + export); `?auth=ok` +
  `AuthReturnNotice` toast — OAuth returns are no longer silent.
- **PR #36** OAuth-first AuthGate (token behind disclosure); Drive section open by
  default; Settings/admin links admin-gated.
- **PR #37** Studio phone layout — bottom nav + sheets via shared `panelBodies` map.

### Open

- Slice 6 (self-serve sharing via owner-minted invite links) designed, NOT built —
  waiting on user approval (touches server access model).
- Staging click-through pending: phone Studio, guest welcome, OAuth toast, badge.
- Prod promotion (dev→main) after click-through.

## 2026-07-10 — Bundles shipped, Drive picker migration, CI noise fix

**Who:** Claude (single agent; backend + scripts + CI). Session goal: "where are we
stuck, work next" — unstick the queue, then take the deferred strategic items.

### Done this session

- **PR #26 landed** (was stuck as a conflicting draft): only conflict was CURRENT.md;
  resolved, merged to dev, staging deploy + smoke 9/9 PASS.
- **PR #28 — whole-install bundles** (the queued strategic follow-on):
  `npm run install:export/install:import` — every space + `spaces/_server-config.json`
  in one tar.gz of nested space bundles (composes `space-bundle.mjs` exports);
  `--spaces` subset, `--force`, `--owner`; `selfhost` detects install vs space bundles
  by manifest. New `installBundleContracts.test.js` (multi-space + config round-trip,
  subset, force guard). Real-data check: exported the local install (6 spaces, 98 MB),
  imported into a fresh root cleanly. Docs: SELF_HOST.md.
- **PR #29 — Drive `drive.readonly` → `drive.file` + Google Picker** (clears the
  Google-verification blocker permanently): new `picker-token` endpoint (caller's own
  token + `GOOGLE_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_APP_ID`), shared `pick()` in `useDriveImport`
  (loads Picker on demand, imports via the existing selection path), one
  "Pick from Drive" button per surface, search now lists previously picked files.
  Wiki + `docs/ops/GOOGLE_DRIVE_INTEGRATION.md` updated. NOT runtime-tested —
  needs Cloud console (Picker API, drive.file scope, GOOGLE_APP_ID) + a real-account
  click-through on staging.
- **PR #30 — `open-pr` red-X fixed**: the fork-side auto-PR template also ran
  upstream where `UPSTREAM_PR_TOKEN` doesn't exist. Job-level repo guard (mirrored in
  `docs/templates/fork-auto-pr.yml`); verified skipped on its own push. Known-fixes row.
- Triaged PR #24 (fork `work/session`): zero code — playwright logs + `public/taron/`
  assets; left alone as someone's live WIP. Restored stray `spaces/wcc/scene.json`
  working-tree deletion.

### Next

- User: Cloud console setup + Drive click-through on staging; WCC real-mouse check on
  prod; GitHub App key from a host shell. Then promote dev→main.
- Strategic: P2P/IPFS direction per MANIFESTO (design doc first — CAS blobs and
  bundles are already content-addressed, natural fit).

## 2026-07-09 (late) — Space-card preview optimization

**Who:** Claude (single agent; UX + viewport). Follow-up to the live previews:
"i like it but need to optimized".

### Done this session

- **Low-power viewport mode** (`StudioViewport.jsx`, new `lowPower` prop): preview
  renders at full rate for 8s while assets stream in, then drops to
  `frameloop="demand"` — idle GPU cost ~0; live-sync ops re-render through React,
  which invalidates demand mode, so thumbnails still track edits. DPR pinned to 1
  (was up to 2 — 4× the pixels for a ~340px card) and `powerPreference: 'low-power'`
  so browsers may pick the integrated GPU. `PublicProjectViewer` passes
  `lowPower={isPreview}`; the real viewer is untouched.
- **Boot queue** (`SpaceHub.jsx`): at most 2 preview iframes boot concurrently
  (each is a full app instance — 4+ simultaneous boots janked first paint). A slot
  frees on iframe load, card unmount/scroll-away, or a 15s backstop.
- Tests: boot-queue test (2 mount, third waits, load frees a slot) + `low:` flag in
  viewer preview tests. Trade-off accepted: keyframe/shader animation freezes in
  thumbnails after the 8s settle — still a live frame, desirable for a grid of cards.
- **Virtual-viewport scaling** (follow-up: "previews is big than the window"): the
  iframe lays out at 1024×576 and is CSS-`scale()`d to the card (ResizeObserver keeps
  the scale on resize) — previews now show a true desktop miniature instead of the
  page's cramped mobile layout zoomed into the thumbnail.
- **Preview manager** (follow-up: "need place to manage… put image"): new Preview
  button on managed cards opens a panel — upload a custom cover image or switch back
  to the live miniature. New `spaces.preview_image_asset_id` column (ensureColumn
  migration); PATCH validates the asset exists in the space (400 malformed / 404
  missing), image served from the existing public space-assets route. Contract test +
  SpaceHub tests + wiki line.

### Next

- One-command self-host: portable space bundle (blobs + projects + meta) + bootstrap.

---

## 2026-07-09 (night) — Live previews on Spaces-hub cards

**Who:** Claude (single agent; UX + shared viewer). Finished the uncommitted SpaceHub
preview WIP found in the tree, per Gevorg's ask ("preview of spaces which has live").

### Done this session

- **Space cards** (`SpaceHub.jsx`, `studio-space-hub.css`): public spaces with a linked
  project show a 16:9 live preview — a real miniature of the published route. Smart
  loading: `SpaceCardPreview` mounts its iframe via IntersectionObserver only while the
  card is near the viewport and unmounts when scrolled away (frees the WebGL context);
  `pointer-events: none` keeps the card itself the click target.
- **Viewer preview mode** (`PublicProjectViewer.jsx`): `?preview=1` renders the authored
  orbit camera with navigation disabled and no chrome — Walk/Fly, Enter AR/VR, and the
  viewport fullscreen button all hidden (new `showChrome` prop on `StudioViewport`,
  default true). Document still live-syncs, so thumbnails follow what's published.
- Tests: SpaceHub preview gating (public+linked only, `?preview=1` src, IO mount) and
  viewer preview/non-preview flag tests. Wiki: publishing article line.

### Next

- One-command self-host: portable space bundle (blobs + projects + meta) + bootstrap.

---

## 2026-07-09 (eve) — Per-space CAS blob store (owner-approved storage change)

**Who:** Claude (single agent; BAE). Storage-format change approved by Gevorg in-session
(manifesto non-negotiable #2/#4 gate).

### Done this session

- **Blob store** (`serverXR/src/blobStore.js`): `spaces/<spaceId>/blobs/<sha256>` holds bytes
  once per space. Project uploads with sha256 ids write the blob (skip if present) plus a
  per-project `assets/<sha256>.json` reference — no more per-project binary copies. Legacy
  uuid-style ids keep the old project-local layout.
- **Reference-safe semantics** (`projectRoutes.js`): GET serves legacy local binary first,
  else the space blob but only while the project holds the meta reference (deleted assets
  404 even though the blob survives for other projects). DELETE removes only the reference.
  `/meta` probe updated for blob-backed assets.
- **GC** (`scripts/gc-space-blobs.mjs`): removes blobs no project references; dry run by
  default, `--apply` to delete, `--space`/`--spaces-dir` filters. Asset routes never
  delete blobs.
- Contract test covers: one blob for two projects, delete-in-A keeps B alive, legacy
  binary serve/delete, GC keeps referenced + reclaims orphaned. Backend README API
  section rewritten; wiki line updated.
- No client changes needed — dedupe probe (`/meta`) semantics preserved.

### Next

- One-command self-host: portable space bundle (blobs + projects + meta) + bootstrap.

---

## 2026-07-09 (later) — Content-addressed assets: client pre-hash, dedupe, integrity verify

**Who:** Claude (single agent; BAE + shared project layer)

### Done this session

- **Client pre-hash + upload dedupe** (`src/project/services/projectsApi.js`): `hashFileSha256`
  via `crypto.subtle`; `uploadProjectAsset` checks the new
  `GET /api/projects/:id/assets/:assetId/meta` endpoint and skips the byte upload when the
  project already holds the content (sha256-shaped ids only — legacy uuid ids still
  overwrite-upload). Returned meta adopts the current file's name. Degrades gracefully
  against servers without `/meta` and non-secure contexts (server hashes on receipt as before).
- **Server integrity verify** (`serverXR/src/assetHash.js`, `routes/projectRoutes.js`,
  `routes/spaceRoutes.js`): a client-supplied sha256-shaped `assetId` is now stream-hashed
  and rejected with 400 on mismatch — previously any bytes could replace an immutable-cached
  content address. Server-side hashing now streams instead of buffering whole files.
- Contract test `content-addresses project assets…` (assign / meta 200 / meta 404 / forged-id
  400 keeps original bytes / matching-id accepted), 4 client unit tests, known-fixes row,
  wiki line in "How content flows".

### Validation

`lint` ✓ · `build` ✓ · `test --run` 508/508 ✓ · `test:server-contracts` 36/36 ✓ ·
`docs:wiki:check` ✓ · `docs:ai:check` ✓

### Next

- Cross-project/space shared CAS store (one blob per hash per space) → one-command self-host.

## 2026-07-07 — Full audit (app + AI layer), then closed every finding it raised

**Who:** Claude (single agent; built on the morning's 6-way parallel audit)

### Done this session

- **Full audit** of the codebase, the AI instruction layer (~110 files — first time audited), CI,
  and the competitive landscape. Report artifact:
  <https://claude.ai/code/artifact/210249cb-5815-4db6-8acb-b0edf5b0fd85>. All findings transcribed
  into `docs/ai/audit-2026-07-07.md` (the durable tracker) and then **fixed in the same session**:
- **P0** (`e65bf16`, `e02a1d2`): gizmo icon mojibake, Shift+D double-duplicate, 7 a11y lint
  warnings (0-warning baseline restored); stale agent baselines/CHEATSHEET CI claims corrected;
  stale merged worktrees removed.
- **P1 security** (`1561fc3`): zero-dep rate limiting on guest-session issuance/login/OAuth/
  sync-key-mint/uploads; AUTH_SESSION_SECRET fallback warning; WCC postMessage origin check;
  Drive folderId escaping; syncRoutes off global fetch + contract test banning global fetch in
  serverXR forever.
- **P2 reliability** (`f0e5410`): Studio camera-controls ref rewired via pane registration —
  un-broke save-view, frame-selected, double-click placement, XR restore, saved-view-on-load;
  socket reconnects after unexpected disconnects; V1-scene asset delete guard; image-load
  placeholder; portal navigation via appNavigate.
- **Schema-mirror drift — the session's biggest catch** (`8b639f4`): rewrote schema-sync as a real
  ESM↔CJS equivalence test; it instantly exposed that the server's hand-mirrored CJS was
  **coercing all light/group entities to boxes and stripping `parentId`** on every server-side
  normalization. Mirror synced; the drift class now fails the pre-push gate with a real diff.
- **Lows** (`3f16755`) + **dead-code sweep** (`e397e16`): export credentials scoped to
  first-party URLs; capture-rule/data-cleanup sharp edges; wiki shortcuts refreshed; ~1,500
  verified-dead lines deleted (runtimeSchema, desktop shells, OpCreateDialog, resolvePortValue,
  projectStore vestiges, orphaned WCC CSS, useStudioLayoutPrefs).

### Validation

- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, **0 warnings** · `npm run build` — pass
- `npm run test -- --run` — 423/423 · server-contracts 29/29 · schema-sync 16/16 (now a real
  equivalence check) · `docs:ai:check` + `docs:wiki:check` — pass · `npm audit` — 0 vulns
- Staging smoke 9/9 after every push; prod smoke 9/9 after the P0 promotion.

### Open

- Promote the P1/P2/schema/Low/sweep commits `dev` → `main` (P0 already live on prod).
- Drive prod live-check + Google OAuth sensitive-scope verification (manual, user-only).
- GitHub-sync App webhook untested against a real repo push.
- Medium-confidence dead code deferred (V1 layoutMode plumbing, e2e-smoke.mjs — see tracker).

## 2026-06-24 — Portal object, landing CTAs, placement UX, paired audit

**Who:** Claude (multiple agents, parallel)

### Done this session

- **Portal object** (`d82f718`, `b859236`, `e2a3172`): a Studio entity that references another project — embed it inline or act as a gateway. Added `portal` as a 14th entity type in the shared `src/project/viewport/EntityContent.jsx` + `PortalObject.jsx`, with tests asserting `EntityContent` dispatches portal entities correctly. Same commit line also added view-centred placement, double-click-to-place, and portal name pickers.
- **WCC landing button + perf** (`d82f718` swept the wcc/landing edits, `09f5e05` for main landing): "Enter exhibition" restyled to solid red (`#d90000`) + white border; main di.iiii landing's "WCC Exhibition" CTA made red to match (`landing-cta-wcc`). Perf: ambient dots moved off layout-thrashing `margin` keyframes to compositor `transform` via `@property --dot-x/--dot-y`; pointer-parallax caches circle layout boxes instead of `getBoundingClientRect` per move. ~61fps desktop; remaining throttled cost is the always-on WebGL particle veil.
- **Paired deep audit** (`docs/ai/audit-2026-06-24-as-built.md` + `-as-documented.md`): same project audited two ways — as the code exactly is (all 7 gates green, 334 tests, 44 endpoints, ~57k LOC) and as the docs portray it. Surfaced that the *memory layer* drifts, not the code: PROGRESS was ~3 sessions behind, the manifesto's asset-ID seed was silently done, and the viewport Tier-1 plan had landed without being marked. Those drift items fixed alongside this entry.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` — pass (0 errors, 6 pre-existing a11y warnings)
- `npm run build` — pass (0 circular-dep warnings)
- `npm run test -- --run` — 334/334
- `npm run test:server-contracts` — 21/21 · `npm run test:schema-sync` — 13/13 · `check:three-vendor` — pass

### Open

- `dev` ahead of `main` — portal + landing live on staging, **not yet in production**.
- OAuth round-trip still unverified end-to-end. WCC hub `main` project still a placeholder sphere. Viewport extraction Tier 2/3 still open.

---

## 2026-06-23 — Walk/fly + XR locomotion, viewport de-dup, admin rewrite

**Who:** Claude (+ Codex)

### Done this session

- **Walk/fly locomotion overhaul** (`223e7b1`, `bac2e05`, `2bbf74f`, `e7ebbf2`): strafe, wider look range, drone-style decoupled flight, mobile fly support with touch up/down ascend controls, and a Walk/Fly toggle on every public space. Ported the fixes into `WccExhibition`'s duplicated `Walker`.
- **XR locomotion from scratch** (`8206780`, `e85469a`, `d6e8b6e`, `66d42f6`, `450cffc`, `5fbdd15`, `03c9b10`, `b000166`): no VR/AR movement existed before. Added AR joystick (joy.x turns, joy.y walks forward off the real camera forward), VR thumbstick locomotion + fly via right-stick Y, AR dom-overlay portal so the joystick composites in handheld AR, and AR-on-every-public-space by default (`xrDefaultMode` modifies it). Stopped the `Walker` from clobbering the camera during XR sessions.
- **Shared viewport extraction Tier 1** (`b860aba`, `448b193`): extracted `EntityContent` + `buildAssetMap` into `src/project/viewport/`, collapsing the 4× duplicated entity→object switch into one canonical renderer; added the fork-map + extraction-plan docs.
- **Admin UI rewrite** (`f1e7f93`, `d82f6f5`): section-based admin layout replacing the single-scroll mega page; repaired the stale `PreferencesPage` assertions it broke.
- **Landing + deploy fixes** (`2e50438`, `f295bd5`, `b79e109`, `5b77069`, plus dev-tooling `c8ff430`/`22b8150`): fixed the fixed-3D-background hiding section content, restored inline fly/walk + main-space sync, silenced 401/404 noise on envs without a public `main`, and added cron-independent deploy-backup pruning.

### Validation

- All work validated per-commit with lint/build/test; the 2026-06-22 audit (run just before) confirmed the suite green going into this session.

---

## 2026-06-22 — Full system audit + landing page fixes

**Who:** Claude

### Done this session

- Ran a full audit of `dev` (lint, build, full vitest suite, server-contracts, schema-sync, three-vendor, docs:ai:check — all pass) plus a live manual walkthrough (Studio, WCC, asset upload, SpaceSyncPanel, live staging dry-run sync). Full findings in `docs/ai/audit-2026-06-22.md`. `scripts/e2e-smoke.mjs`'s 16 failures were root-caused to the script itself (stale `default-scene-test` fixture ID, stale Studio tab selectors, Beta's by-design empty-canvas-until-Node-0 behavior) — not app bugs; script still needs updating, not done this session.
- **Real bug found + fixed:** landing page sections below the hero (`What is di.iiii?`, `How to use di.iiii`, `Made for everyone`, etc.) rendered with only their eyebrow label visible — body text/cards were invisible because `GridFloorBackground`'s `position: fixed; z-index: 0` canvas spans the whole scrollable page and paints over non-positioned static section content. Fixed by giving `.lp-section` `position: relative; z-index: 1; background: var(--di-black)`, matching the pattern already used on `.lp-hero-inner`. See `docs/ai/known-fixes.md`.
- **Copy fix:** landing page credit lines referenced "Hayfilm Studio," which doesn't appear anywhere in the project's own identity deck (`docs/deck/di.ii XR studio_network.pdf` — real identity is "di.i — XR studio_network", site `thedi.studio`). Changed `src/landing/LandingPage.jsx`'s Ready-section line to "Armenia · Web XR · thedi.studio" and the footer note to "Open source · Web XR · thedi.studio".
- OAuth round-trip remains unverified in this dev environment (still an open item from prior sessions — user completed a real login but the session check method used couldn't confirm it from this side).
- Set up a personal (outside-repo) dev-browser launcher at `~/bin/di-dev-browser` — isolated flatpak Chromium profile for testing, `--wipe` flag to reset. Not part of the repo.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` — pass (0 errors, 6 pre-existing a11y warnings)
- `npm run build` — pass
- `npm run test -- --run` — 326/326 pass
- `npm run test:server-contracts` — 21/21 pass
- `npm run test:schema-sync` — 13/13 pass
- Manual browser verification (Playwright) of the landing-page fix before/after, and of the copy change live on `localhost:5173`

---

## 2026-06-19 — Opt-in GLB optimization during Studio import

**Who:** Codex

### Done this session

- Added a 10 MB threshold for recommending optimization of newly imported `.glb` models.
- Added a Studio decision dialog with Optimize & upload, Upload original, and Cancel paths.
- Added a lazy browser worker that resizes embedded textures to 2048px WebP, deduplicates/welds/prunes model data, and quantizes without geometry simplification.
- Added a two-minute timeout and original-upload fallback when optimization fails.
- Verified a real 14.4 MB WCC gate model optimized to 1.9 MB in 3.8 seconds (87% reduction) with no browser errors.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` — pass
- `npm run build` — pass
- `npm run test -- --run` — 316/321 passed in a three-way parallel run; five server tests timed out under contention
- `npm run test:server-contracts` — pass, 20/20 when rerun serially
- Browser dialog smoke — pass

---

## 2026-06-19 — Portable Studio Export With Assets

- Export now produces one `.studio.zip` containing `project.json` and every project asset binary under `assets/<asset-id>/`.
- Asset-heavy exports now show live download/packing progress, fetch up to three assets concurrently, and use STORE mode instead of recompressing GLB/MP4/JPG payloads.
- Manual browser automation against WCC (asset responses stubbed small) produced `wcc.studio.zip` with zero page errors.
- Export fails with a visible activity error if any asset cannot be downloaded, preventing silently incomplete archives.
- Import accepts both `.studio.zip` and legacy `.studio.json`; bundled assets are re-uploaded into the current project using their stable asset IDs before document replacement.
- Bundle round-trip tests pass 3/3, full lint and build pass. The full suite reached 310/319 before nine files hit shared 5-second timeouts under sustained load; all nine passed 32/32 when rerun with two workers.

---

## 2026-06-19 — Studio V1 Selection/Highlight Parity

- Added V1-style orange primary and green secondary bounding-box highlights that track transformed objects.
- Selection IDs are deduplicated, validated against the document, and pruned after deletes/replacements.
- `A` selects visible, unlocked entities; Alt+A and Escape clear; `F` frames the full visible selection or all visible entities when selection is empty.
- Hidden entities no longer render. Locked entities can still be selected/inspected/highlighted but do not receive transform gizmos.
- Structure supports Ctrl/Cmd/Shift additive selection and labels hidden, locked, and primary rows; Inspector reports selection count and primary entity.
- Focused parity tests pass 14/14; complete suite passes 316/316 with four workers; full lint and production build pass.

---

## 2026-06-19 — Studio Multi-Selection Gizmo

- `A` already selected all entities; Studio now renders one shared centroid gizmo for any selection of two or more.
- Dragging G/R/S previews the matrix delta on every selected entity and commits one batched operation on release for coherent undo/history.
- X/Y/Z axis visibility applies to the shared gizmo. Single selections retain the existing per-entity gizmo.
- Matrix tests cover centroid, group translation, and group scaling; touched suites pass 10/10, scoped lint is clean, and production build passes.

---

## 2026-06-19 — Studio Transform Hotkey/Button Parity

- Keyboard `G/R/S` now selects translate/rotate/scale gizmos exactly like clicking the matching toolbar buttons; it no longer launches the separate modal operator.
- Added coverage for all three key-to-gizmo mappings and verifies the modal start callback is not called.
- Added `X/Y/Z` constraints to the active gizmo by wiring axis state to `TransformControls.showX/showY/showZ`; repeated axis restores all, and changing G/R/S clears the constraint.
- Bare X is now reserved for axis constraint; Delete/Backspace still delete and Ctrl/Cmd+X still cuts. Axis/mode tests (7/7), lint, and build pass.

---

## 2026-06-19 — Studio Floating Panel Controls

- Fixed close/collapse controls being swallowed by draggable-header pointer capture in Firefox.
- `usePanelDrag` now ignores interactive descendants when deciding whether to start a drag.
- Added a regression test; focused test, full lint, and production build pass.

---

## 2026-06-19 — Duplicate Vite Dev-Stack Guard

- Diagnosed Studio module-load failures on port 5174 as two concurrent `npm run dev` stacks.
- Set `server.strictPort: true` so duplicate Vite startup fails instead of drifting away from the HMR port.
- Stopped only the duplicate 5174 stack; the original frontend remains available on 5173.
- Enabled WebSocket forwarding on the `/serverXR` Vite proxy so Socket.IO can upgrade from polling during local development.
- Validation: `npm run build` passed; `/studio/StudioApp.jsx` returned 200 on 5173; duplicate `npm run dev:client` failed as expected with port-in-use.

---

## 2026-06-10 — Space and project workflow

**Who:** Copilot

### Done this session

- Documented the default space → Studio/Beta → public workflow in `README.md`.
- Added a workflow card to Studio Hub for space creation, project development, and publishing.
- Added a workflow card to Beta Hub for experimental project development and handoff to Studio.

### Validation

- `npm run build`

---

## 2026-05-10 — Beta graph-first workspace + world node

**Who:** Gevorg + Claude

### Done

- **Graph as primary surface** — `BetaViewSurface` removed; `BetaGraphSurface` is the permanent canvas
- **Topbar seeding** — topbar is hidden until `universe.node0` is placed; fades in on Node 0 creation
- **`universe.world` node** — singleton panel-2d node replacing the ad-hoc system viewport window
  - Panel mode: resizable `DesktopWindow` with `BetaViewport` inside
  - Overlay mode (◫): 3D world renders as transparent background behind graph
  - Fullscreen mode (⤢): world takes over screen; topbar "← World" exits
- **NodePalette**: removed `slice(0, 8)` cap; all matching nodes visible with arrow-key scroll tracking
- **`Node0PanelWindow`** and **`WorldPanelWindow`** added as dedicated panel components
- `universe.world` added to `SINGLETON_TYPE_IDS` in `projectSchema.js`
- Committed `3e8824a` to `dev` + `staging`; cPanel deploy confirmed live on `staging.di-studio.xyz`

### Validation

- `npm run test` — 81 files / 284 tests — all pass

---

## 2026-05-04d — Bundle Fix + SHA-256 Asset IDs

**Who:** Copilot

### Done this session

**Content-addressed asset IDs (complete):**
- Both upload routes (`projectRoutes.js`, `spaceRoutes.js`) already used SHA-256 — done in a prior session.
- Removed the dead `|| crypto.randomUUID()` fallback from `buildProjectAssetMeta` in `serverXR/src/projectStore.js`.
- Function now throws `Error('assetId is required')` if called without one — misuse is immediately visible.
- Removed now-unused `const crypto = require('node:crypto')` import from `projectStore.js`.

**Bundle manualChunks fix:**
- Root cause: the previous `manualChunks` omitted drei's peer deps (`detect-gpu`, `maath`, `camera-controls`, `@react-spring/three`, `@monogrid/gainmap-js`). Those landed in `vendor`, imported `three`, creating `three-vendor → vendor → three-vendor` circular init order → TDZ crash in production (SES/lockdown).
- Fix: added all missing drei peer deps to the `three-vendor` group in `vite.config.js`.
- Build now produces **no circular chunk warning**. Chunk caching is now clean: `three-vendor` and `vendor` are stable across app changes.
- **Needs runtime verification on staging** — the prior TDZ crash was a browser runtime issue. Monitor after next staging deploy.

### Files changed

- `vite.config.js` — restored manualChunks with complete drei peer dep list
- `serverXR/src/projectStore.js` — removed randomUUID fallback, removed crypto import
- `PROGRESS.md` — this entry

### Validation

- `npx vite build` — clean, no circular chunk warning
- `npx vitest run` — 79 files / 274 tests — all pass

### Easy wins (pick any next)

1. ~~**Routing**~~ — done. `react-router-dom@6` installed; `BrowserRouter` in `RootApp`, `useLocation()` in `AppRouter`/`useAppRoute`, `initialRoute` prop passed down to `StudioApp`/`BetaApp`. 274/274 tests pass.
2. ~~**GitHub Actions deploy**~~ — done. `deploy-staging-ssh.yml` is complete and tested in CI. Remaining step is ops-only: add `staging` environment secrets to GitHub repo settings (`STAGING_SSH_HOST`, `STAGING_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `STAGING_WEB_ROOT`, `STAGING_SERVER_ROOT`, `STAGING_SHARED_ROOT`) and set `ENABLE_SSH_STAGING_DEPLOY=true`. See `docs/deploy/SSH_STAGING_DEPLOY.md`.

## 2026-05-04c — Manifesto Shortcut Capture Rule

**Who:** Copilot

### Done this session

- Added a permanent manifesto section requiring short reusable solution notes after solved tasks.
- Defined a compact template: Problem, Short way, Verification, Source files/commands.

### Why

- Prevent repeat investigation of already solved paths.
- Keep operational memory compact and immediately actionable.

### Files changed

- `MANIFESTO.md`

### Follow-up update

- Added a concrete shortcut entry for staging publish failures: missing `deploy/cpanel/cpanel.prebuilt.yml`, repromote flow, and verification checklist.

## 2026-05-04b — Outliner Panel + Tests

**Who:** Gevorg + Claude

### Done this session

**Outliner panel (node count badge → clickable toggle):**

- Converted `<span class="beta-topbar-node-count">` to a `<button>` that toggles an Outliner window
- `surfaceNodes` memo reuses the filtered array for both the count and the outliner list (was computing separately before)
- Created `OutlinerPanelWindow.jsx` — lists nodes for the active surface, shows type label + node label, highlights selected node with `is-selected`
- Outliner window is a floating `DesktopWindow`, draggable/resizable, available on all three surfaces
- CSS: node count button gets `appearance: none` reset, hover/active color brightening; `.beta-outliner button.is-selected` added

**Tests:**

- `OutlinerPanelWindow.test.jsx` — 5 tests: empty state, node list rendering, typeId fallback, is-selected class, click callback
- `BetaEditor.test.jsx` — 4 new outliner toggle tests: no button when empty, button appears with nodes, opens dialog on click, closes on second click

### Validation

- `npm run test` — 79 files / 270 tests — all pass

### Easy wins (pick any next)

1. **Bundle size follow-up** — drei subpath imports (note: `sideEffects: false` is already set in drei's package.json so tree-shaking from the index works; investigate whether chunk inflation from dynamic import boundaries is addressable with a different Rollup strategy instead)
2. **Routing** — replace manual `window.location`/`popstate` with a router library (medium-large scope; current system is clean and tested — weigh carefully)
3. ~~**Outliner node-type icon/colour**~~ — done. `OutlinerPanelWindow` already renders `.beta-outliner-dot` with `getCategoryColor(typeDef?.category)` and CSS grid layout.

## 2026-05-04 — geom.plane Texture + Initial Bundle Optimization

**Who:** Gevorg + Claude

### Done this session

**`geom.plane` texture support:**

- Added `textureUrl` string port to `geom.plane` in `nodeRegistry.js`
- Added `PlaneWithTexture` component in `BetaViewport.jsx` using `useTexture` from drei
- When `textureUrl` is set, renders with texture mapped; falls back to solid color otherwise
- Loads lazily inside existing `<Suspense>` boundary — no new Suspense needed

**Initial bundle optimization (index.js: 459kB → 30kB gzip):**

- Made `App`, `BlankNodeWorkspaceApp`, and `PublicProjectViewer` lazy in `SpaceSurfaceApp.jsx`
- Made `SceneCanvas`, `PresentationCanvas`, and drei `Loader` lazy in `EditorLayout.jsx`
- Fixed `SpaceSurfaceApp.test.jsx` — two sync `getByText` checks updated to async `findByText` to match new lazy rendering
- Updated `manualChunks` in `vite.config.js`: merged `xr-vendor` into `react-three`, added `@react-spring/three` to prevent circular chunk warnings; removed stale comment
- Known tradeoff: Three.js lazy chunks are larger than original (tree-shaking is less aggressive across dynamic import boundaries). Initial render is dramatically faster for landing pages and non-3D workflows.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 5 pre-existing warnings (unchanged)
- `npm run test` — 78 files / 261 tests — all pass

### Easy wins (pick any next)

1. **GitHub Actions deploy** — replace cPanel cron. Push to `staging` → build → rsync + SSH restart. IE role. New workflow file.
2. **Outliner panel** — node count badge in topbar has no click target. Wire it to an outliner panel.
3. **Bundle size follow-up** — `drei` tree-shaking regresses with lazy imports. Root fix: use drei subpath imports (`@react-three/drei/web/Grid`) instead of top-level index in viewport components. ~15 targeted import changes.
4. **Routing** — replace manual `window.location`/`popstate` with a router library.

## 2026-05-04 — Undo/Redo + AI Company Structure + Ollama Integration

**Who:** Gevorg + Claude

### Changes

**Undo/redo in Beta editor:**
- Wrapped `applyLocalOps` with a history-tracking layer inside `BetaEditor.jsx`
- All structural ops (everything except `setWorkspaceState`) push the current document to a 50-entry undo stack
- `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` restores previous document state via `replace-document` dispatch
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` redoes
- Input/textarea fields correctly ignore the shortcut
- Fixed stale `windowLayout.test.js` assertions (expected old formula values, now reflect `bottom + 8`)

**AI company structure** (`docs/ai/roles/`):
- 10 role cards: UI/UX Engineer, Node System Engineer, 3D/Viewport Engineer, Backend/API Engineer, Schema/Protocol Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, QA/Test Engineer, Security Auditor, Technical Architect, Documentation Engineer
- Each card has: owned files, forbidden files, elite domain knowledge, done criteria
- Role routing table added to root `AGENTS.md`

**Token efficiency + Ollama integration:**
- `scripts/ollama-task.sh` — safe CLI wrapper for 5 Ollama tiers (fast/deep/coder/general/tiny)
- `dob-fast` and `dob-deep` are project-fine-tuned — called without system prompt override
- Model routing guide at `docs/ai/roles/model-routing.md`
- Token budget rules added to `AGENTS.md` (startup context limits, tool budgets)
- All 4 AI tools (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor) now receive role routing table + token efficiency rules via their bridge files
- `npm run docs:ai:sync` regenerates all 16 bridge files automatically

### Validation

- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 5 pre-existing warnings (unchanged)
- `npm run test` — 78 files / 261 tests — all pass
- `npm run docs:ai:check` — pass

### Easy wins (pick any next)

1. **`geom.plane` texture** — add `textureUrl` port in `nodeRegistry.js`, read with `useTexture` in `BetaViewport.jsx`. ~30 lines. NSE + VPE.
2. **GitHub Actions deploy** — replace cPanel cron. Push to `staging` → build → rsync + SSH restart. IE role. New workflow file.
3. ~~**Content-addressed asset IDs**~~ — done. Both project and space upload routes use `SHA-256(file content)`. `buildProjectAssetMeta` fallback removed.
4. **Outliner panel** — node count badge in topbar has no click target. Wire it to an outliner panel.

---

## 2026-05-04 — Beta Layout Fixes + Full Surface Testing

**Who:** Copilot

### Done this session

Created `default-scene-test` project and systematically tested all three Beta editor surfaces. Found and fixed 4 layout bugs.

**Fixed:**
1. **Dead space below topbar**: `DEFAULT_BETA_WORKSPACE_TOP` was 168px (old value from before topbar redesign). Changed to 64px, updated `getWorkspaceTopInset` formula to `return bottom > 0 ? bottom + 8 : DEFAULT_BETA_WORKSPACE_TOP`.
2. **Viewport starts at y=0 when workflow strip hidden**: `workflowHeight` fallback was `0`, so surfaces started under topbar. Changed fallback to `workspaceTop`.
3. **Workflow strip not hiding when cube exists**: `hasWorldContent = entities.length > 0` only checked legacy entities. Beta nodes live in `document.nodes`. Fixed to `entities.length > 0 || nodes.length > 0`.
4. **Inspector overlapping workflow strip**: `.beta-selection-scaffold` had `top: 64px` hardcoded in CSS. When workflow strip height ~150px, inspector overlapped it. Added `style={{ top: workflowHeight + 'px' }}` to override.

**Tested and verified:**
- World surface: cube visible at [0,0.5,0], clickable, inspector updates on selection, no layout overlaps
- Graph surface: node cards visible, port connections show, inspector works, no overlaps  
- View surface: text panel floating window at correct position, draggable, workflow strip hides when view nodes exist

**Files changed:**
- `src/beta/utils/windowLayout.js` — DEFAULT_BETA_WORKSPACE_TOP 168→64, formula updated
- `src/beta/components/BetaEditor.jsx` — 4 fixes: workflowHeight fallback, hasWorldContent, inspector top, (surface switching)

### Follow-up fixes

- Made Beta selection surface-aware so World/View no longer inherit an unrelated selected node from another surface.
- Scoped the topbar node count to the active surface instead of counting the full mixed document.
- Filtered `view.image` asset picker options to image assets only so the node UI no longer offers incompatible project assets.
- Added focused tests for the asset-filtering inspector behavior.
- Fixed `OpCreateDialog` render loop on `Add View Node` / `Add World Node`: stable selection now comes from the memoized definitions list, which prevents the `Maximum update depth exceeded` warning when opening the create dialog.
- Completed live Beta checks for remaining todos: View surface OK, add-node flow OK (created Browser node), and graph wiring OK (created a `value.color -> geom.cube.color` edge in `default-scene-test`).

### Validation

- `npm run lint` — pass
- All surfaces load cleanly with no console errors
- Cube visible and selectable in World; inspector shows Cube ports
- Graph shows node cards with ports; edges visible as wires
- View shows floating text panel at correct y position; no overlap with topbar

## 2026-05-04 — Beta Graph Node Dragging + Visibility Fix

**Who:** Codex

### Done this session

- Fixed Beta Graph surface not showing node cards: removed inline `position: 'relative'` that was breaking `position: absolute; inset: 0` CSS.
- Fixed `topInset` calculation to use `offsetTop + offsetHeight` for proper workflow strip offset.
- Added auto-scroll to Graph surface on mount to show nodes.
- **Added drag-to-move for graph nodes**: nodes now respond to click-and-drag to reposition in the graph canvas. Cursor changes to `grab`/`grabbing` to indicate affordance.
- Connected drag callback (`onMoveNode`) to persist `graphX`/`graphY` via `updateNode` operations.
- **Fixed UI overlap issues**: Workflow strip now hides when content exists on the active surface (hidden on World when entities exist, hidden on Graph when nodes exist, hidden on View when view nodes exist).

### Validation

- Node cards visible and interactive.
- Graph drag-to-move tested: moved node by (150px, 100px) and confirmed position updated.
- Workflow strip hidden on all surfaces with content (tested World and Graph).
- World viewport fully visible with no overlays.
- Graph editor showing 6 nodes with connection wires visible.
- Inspector panel positioned non-overlapping on right.
- All surfaces layout correctly with topbar and optional workflow hints.

### Completed Features

✅ Graph visibility (nodes now show)
✅ Node dragging (drag to reposition)  
✅ UI layout (no overlaps, clean workspace)
✅ Workflow hinting (shows only when empty)

## 2026-05-03 — Beta Empty World Affordance

**Who:** Gevorg + Codex

### Done this session

- Replaced the faint empty-world hint with a visible onboarding overlay in Beta World.
- Added a bright framed target area, crosshair, and a centered `Add World Node` button so users do not have to guess where to double-click.
- Kept double-click support, but added a direct first-action button for dark-grid scenes where the interaction was too hidden.
- Added focused viewport tests for the empty-world CTA.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm run test -- src/beta/components/BetaViewport.test.jsx src/beta/components/BetaHelpDialog.test.jsx src/beta/components/BetaHub.test.jsx src/beta/utils/betaGuide.test.js src/beta/components/BetaEditor.test.jsx` passed.

---

## 2026-05-03 — Beta Visitor/Creator First Landing

**Who:** Gevorg + Codex

### Done this session

- Added a visual Beta hub onboarding split for two audiences: `For Visitors` and `For Creators`.
- Added audience-specific steps and actions so visitors can go to the public space while creators can jump into project creation.
- Extended the in-app Beta help `Start Here` section with matching visitor/creator guidance cards.
- Updated the Beta user manual so the written docs now begin with the same two entry paths.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm run test -- src/beta/components/BetaHub.test.jsx src/beta/components/BetaHelpDialog.test.jsx src/beta/utils/betaGuide.test.js src/beta/components/BetaEditor.test.jsx` passed.

---

## 2026-05-03 — Beta Help Flow + User Manual

**Who:** Gevorg + Codex

### Done this session

- Added a Beta in-app help system with surface-aware guidance for `Start Here`, `World`, `View`, and `Graph`.
- Added a topbar `Help` button plus a workflow-strip `How To Use ...` action so users can open guidance from multiple places.
- Added shared Beta guide content in code so the in-app steps stay consistent.
- Added a written Beta manual at `docs/beta/USER_MANUAL.md` covering first steps, first connections, and current Beta expectations.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm run test -- src/beta/components/BetaHelpDialog.test.jsx src/beta/utils/betaGuide.test.js src/beta/utils/surfaceWorkflow.test.js src/beta/components/BetaEditor.test.jsx` passed.

---

## 2026-05-03 — Beta Workflow Strip Layout Fix

**Who:** Gevorg + Codex

### Done this session

- Fixed Beta surface overlap caused by the new workflow strip floating above World/View/Graph content.
- Measured workflow strip height in `BetaEditor.jsx` and passed a live top inset into each active surface.
- Updated `BetaGraphSurface.jsx` and `BetaViewport.jsx` to reserve that inset instead of rendering under the strip.
- Updated Beta surface CSS so the workflow strip participates in normal layout and the View surface honors a dynamic top offset.

### Validation

- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm run test -- src/beta/components/BetaEditor.test.jsx src/beta/components/BetaGraphSurface.test.jsx src/beta/utils/surfaceWorkflow.test.js` passed.

## 2026-05-03 — Handoff Cleanup · Logical Commits · Beta Delete Key

**Who:** Gevorg + Codex

### Done this session

- Fixed `git diff --check` trailing whitespace failures in Studio/shared panel CSS.
- Reviewed the large uncommitted handoff batch and committed it in logical slices:
    - AI task contract + manifesto/golden-rules tooling
    - browser session auth gate and token removal from client requests/sockets
    - SQLite-backed serverXR persistence and migration
    - serverXR Docker image support
    - App/Preferences/StudioShell file splits
    - fallback catch annotations and visible sync warnings
    - di.i visual identity refresh across landing, Studio, Beta, and shared surfaces
- Completed quick Beta editor win: Delete/Backspace now deletes selected nodes/entities in World/View surfaces, while Graph keeps its existing graph-local handler.
- Cleared the remaining lint warnings:
    - moved `useAppState` ref updates out of render and into an effect
    - removed unused imports/destructures in Beta, Preferences, and node registry tests
    - converted intentionally ignored catch bindings to bare `catch`
    - made Beta graph/world/view interactive surfaces keyboard-addressable
- Added the opt-in SSH/VPS staging deploy path:
    - GitHub Actions workflow for `staging` / manual SSH rsync deploys
    - deployment docs for required GitHub variables/secrets and host shape
    - live deploy docs now point to the future SSH staging path while keeping cPanel as current truth
- Cleaned branch hygiene after the deploy workflow push:
    - deleted stale remote `copilot/help-with-pull-request` branch with no open PR
    - fast-forwarded local `main` and `staging` refs to their upstreams
    - closed PRs #9/#10 and deleted their `copilot/*` branches after confirmation to keep only needed branches
- Stabilized the PreferencesPage runtime metadata test by waiting for async backend health metadata before asserting release fields.
- Completed quick Beta editor win: `world.background` nodes now drive the Beta viewport background color, with legacy `worldState.backgroundColor` as fallback.

### Validation

- `git diff --check` passed after whitespace cleanup.
- SSH deploy workflow structural check passed.
- Branch cleanup verification passed: remote branch count is now 5; only `dev`, `staging`, `main`, `cpanel-staging`, and `cpanel-production` remain.
- `npm run docs:ai:sync` passed — bridges already up to date.
- `npm run docs:ai:check` passed.
- `npm run lint` passed with 0 warnings.
- `npm run test` passed: 67 files / 221 tests.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run test:server-contracts` passed: 2 files / 16 tests.
- Focused Beta checks passed: `npm run test -- BetaGraphSurface.test.jsx beta/utils/betaRouting.test.js`.

## 2026-04-29 — AI Task Contract + MCP Guardrails

**Who:** Gevorg + Copilot

### Done this session

- Added a required **AI Task Contract** section to `AGENTS.md` with goal/priority/scope/non-goals/output/done-criteria fields.
- Added **MCP / tool-usage guardrails** to `AGENTS.md` to reduce extra tool calls and out-of-scope edits.
- Added a practical **Task Request Template** section to `README.md` so task prompts are clearer and better prioritized.
- Added `docs/ai/workflows.md` guidance for task intake checks and MCP/tool budgeting.
- Added a new golden rule in `docs/ai/golden_rules.md` to prevent tool-heavy work before contract clarity.
- Tightened contract with strict execution rules: max 2 clarifying questions, scope lock, and explicit end-of-task reporting.
- Added output response contract to keep AI replies concise and structured (summary/changes/validation/risks).
- Extended README template with a copy-paste strict task format for higher prompt control.
- Added an ultra-short default task mode block in `AGENTS.md` for always-on strict behavior.
- Added a required progress status bar contract (`status | phase X/Y | XX% | current | next`) in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added matching progress-bar fields to `README.md` strict task templates.
- Added `docs/ai/workflows.md` progress telemetry rules and blocked-state format.
- Added a universal all-model startup contract in `AGENTS.md` so Claude/Gemini/Copilot/Cursor all inherit the same behavior at project open.
- Updated `docs/ai/agent-support-matrix.md` to explicitly require the same runtime contract across all supported agent entrypoints.
- Ran AI docs maintenance checks:
	- `npm run docs:ai:sync`
	- `npm run docs:ai:check`
	- both passed.

## 2026-04-29 — File Splits · Dockerfile · Manifesto + Golden Rules

**Who:** Gevorg + Claude

### Done this session

- **App.jsx split** — all hook wiring extracted to `src/hooks/useAppState.js`. `App.jsx` is now 56 lines (was 795). Zero behavior change. 219 tests pass.
- **PreferencesPage + StudioShell splits confirmed** — these were done in a previous uncommitted session. Now documented as done.
- **Dockerfile for serverXR** — `serverXR/Dockerfile` finalized. Builds from repo root so `shared/` schema files are baked into the image. Only `/data` (SQLite + assets) is a volume. Runs as non-root user. Build: `docker build -f serverXR/Dockerfile -t dii-server .`
- **`.dockerignore`** — added at repo root. Excludes `node_modules`, `serverXR/data`, `.env`, `.git` from build context.
- **`MANIFESTO.md`** — platform vision, non-negotiables, and architectural seeds. Permanent record. Lives at repo root.
- **`docs/ai/golden_rules.md`** — living record of hard-won solutions and agent behavior rules. Wired into `AGENTS.md` and `docs/ai/index.md`.

## 2026-04-28 — Auth · Storage · Bug Sweep · Architecture Direction

**Who:** Gevorg + Claude

### Done this session

#### Fix 1 — Auth
- Removed `VITE_API_TOKEN` from the client bundle — the raw server token was being baked into the JavaScript at build time and was visible to anyone inspecting the bundle.
- Added `AuthGate` (`src/components/AuthGate.jsx`) — a proper login form shown when `requireAuth=true` and the user has no session. Replaces the old `window.prompt()` fallback.
- Added `useAuthSession` hook (`src/hooks/useAuthSession.js`) — fetches `/api/auth/session`, provides `login()` / `logout()`.
- Session cookies now handle all auth. Sockets already sent `withCredentials: true` so they pick up the session automatically.
- `frontend.env.production.example` no longer sets `VITE_API_TOKEN`.

#### Fix 2 — Storage
- Replaced filesystem JSON stores with SQLite (`better-sqlite3`). All space/project metadata, ops logs, and the project index now live in `{DATA_ROOT}/di.db`. Binary assets remain on disk.
- **Automatic first-startup migration**: existing `meta.json` / `ops.json` files are imported into SQLite and the migration is marked done. No manual step needed on deploy.
- **Race condition on ops fixed**: ops appends are now atomic SQLite transactions.
- **Project index is a query**: `findProjectById` no longer does a two-phase directory scan with a JSON file that could go stale.
- New files: `serverXR/src/db.js`, `serverXR/src/migrate.js`. Config: `DB_PATH` env var to override `{DATA_ROOT}/di.db`.

#### Simplify pass
- Prepared statements cached per DB instance in `spaceStore.js` and `projectStore.js` — built once, reused on every call. ~30-50% latency on metadata hot paths.
- Redundant final SELECT removed from `appendOpsHistory` / `appendProjectOps` — the routes never used the return value.
- Silent op-import failures in `migrate.js` now log with context.

#### Bug sweep
- Fixed 3 bugs where empty `catch {}` blocks were hiding real server errors in `useSceneInitializer.js` and `useLiveSync.js` — errors now surface via `console.warn`.
- Fixed 31 other intentional empty catches with `// ignore` comments — ESLint `no-empty` rule satisfied without changing behavior.
- **Result: 0 lint errors (was 37), 219 tests passing (was 219).**

### Architecture decisions made
- **VPS migration path confirmed**: serverXR backend is the move-critical piece. Frontend (static build) stays on cPanel or moves separately. Next infra step: Dockerfile + GitHub Actions.
- **Decentralization path identified**: op-log is CRDT-compatible. Asset IDs → SHA-256 content hashes would make them IPFS-compatible. These are seeds to plant, not immediate work.

## Current project state — for all readers

### For developers

**What exists and works:**
- Studio editor: project-based 3D scene authoring, inspector, camera, assets upload
- Beta editor: node graph system with typed ports, graph surface, wiring
- Real-time collaboration: Socket.IO + SSE ops sync, cursor sharing
- Auth: session-cookie login form, role-based access (viewer/editor/admin)
- Storage: SQLite for all structured data, filesystem for binary assets
- Deploy: cPanel Node.js App + cron pulling prebuilt GitHub branch

**What is broken or missing:**
- Delete key not wired in world/view surfaces (handler exists, no keyboard listener)
- No undo/redo in Beta editor node ops
- No outliner panel (node count badge exists, no click target)
- `geom.plane` texture port defined in registry but not read by viewport
- `world.background` node defined but viewport still reads from legacy `worldState`

**File sizes:** All three large files have been split.
- `PreferencesPage.jsx` → 443 lines (logic in `usePreferencesData.js`)
- `StudioShell.jsx` → 502 lines (panels in `StudioShellPanels.jsx`)
- `App.jsx` → 56 lines (all hook wiring in `src/hooks/useAppState.js`)

**Bundle issues:**
- `three-core` chunk: 740 kB (not lazy-loaded)
- Public production sourcemaps are disabled in Vite
- Route-level lazy loading exists for Studio/Beta/SpaceSurface, but deeper 3D chunk splitting is still open

**Routing:**
- Manual `window.location` / `popstate` — no router library
- Works but fragile; deep-link support is limited

### For designers and product

**Studio lane** (main shipped product):
- Project hub, project editor, inspector, asset panel, spaces panel, media panel
- Solid but monolithic — the large file sizes reflect this

**Beta lane** (experimental node-first direction):
- Node graph with wiring works
- Visual identity is di.i: black + cyan, square corners, monospace
- Missing: undo/redo, delete key, outliner, full viewport node feedback

**Landing page**: exists, currently double-click to reveal (hidden by default)

**What the platform is becoming**: a spatial editor for immersive XR experiences. Long-term direction is decentralized — scenes stored on IPFS, real-time via WebRTC, no central server dependency. This is the "heritage collection for future generations" vision.

### For infrastructure / ops

**Current deployment:**
- Frontend: cPanel public_html, static files
- Backend: cPanel Node.js App at `/serverXR`, PM2 via ecosystem.config.js
- Deploy trigger: cron job pulls prebuilt branch from GitHub every few minutes
- Data: `serverXR/data/` — SQLite DB + spaces directory with assets

**cPanel limitations hitting us:**
- No reliable process resurrection (PM2 restarts controlled by cPanel, not us)
- Shared disk I/O affects SQLite write performance under load
- No Docker, no background workers
- Awkward deploy pipeline (prebuilt branch model)

**Next infrastructure step:**
- Hetzner CX22 (~€4/mo): 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD
- PM2 for process management
- Nginx reverse proxy
- GitHub Actions: push → build → SSH deploy
- SQLite and assets on a mounted volume

## Easy wins — pick any of these next

> Self-contained. Each one 2-4 hours max. No research needed.

### Infra (unblock future scaling)
1. ~~**Dockerfile for serverXR**~~ — done. Build: `docker build -f serverXR/Dockerfile -t dii-server .` from repo root. Shared schema baked in, only `/data` volume needed at runtime.
2. **GitHub Actions workflow** — replace cPanel cron. Push to `staging` → build frontend → rsync dist + SSH restart.

### Quick feature completions
3. ~~**Delete key in world/view**~~ — done. World/View surfaces now listen for Delete/Backspace outside text inputs.
4. **`geom.plane` texture** — ~~add `textureUrl` port~~ — done (added in 2026-05-04).
5. ~~**`world.background` node drive**~~ — done. Beta viewport now reads the singleton graph node color before falling back to legacy `worldState.backgroundColor`.
6. ~~**Undo/redo in Beta**~~ — done (added in 2026-05-04b).

### File splits (reduce review friction)
7. ~~**Split `PreferencesPage.jsx`**~~ — done (`usePreferencesData.js` + `PreferencesShared.jsx`).
8. ~~**Split `App.jsx`**~~ — done (`useAppState.js` holds all wiring, `App.jsx` is 56 lines).

### Decentralization seeds
9. ~~**Content-addressed asset IDs**~~ — done. Upload routes use `crypto.createHash('sha256')`. `buildProjectAssetMeta` now requires `assetId` (no UUID fallback).

## 2026-04-24 — Node Cards + di.i Visual Identity + Staging Sync

**Who:** Gevorg + Claude
