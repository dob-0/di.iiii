## This session (2026-07-21 — open-jam short link + minimal jam welcome)

- Goal: a minimalist, QR-friendly way for non-technical people to join the
  communal jam and add their own visuals. Backend/auth already supported it
  (guests get an `editor` grant on the `open` space; `open-jam` uploads work) —
  the gap was purely UX/entry.
- Shipped (frontend only, landed on `dev` → staging):
  - **Short link `/open_jam`** — a QR-/flyer-sized alias resolving to the same
    editor state as `/open/studio/projects/open-jam`, no redirect (URL stays
    short). Added in `src/studio/utils/studioRouting.js`
    (`OPEN_JAM_ALIAS_SEGMENT`/`_SPACE_ID`/`_PROJECT_ID`); SPA fallback in
    `nginx.conf` already serves it. Regression test in `studioRouting.test.js`.
  - **Minimal jam welcome** — single-beat coach at `/open_jam` only
    ("Open Create to add your visual to the jam ✨" → "Nice! ✨ Add as many as
    you like" on first add, then fades). Shows once per device for everyone
    (guest or signed-in), separate from the guest walkthrough. `StudioCoachMarks.jsx`
    refactored into a hookless dispatcher + `GuestCoach`/`JamCoach`; helpers in
    `studioGuide.js` (`STUDIO_JAM_COACH_DONE_KEY`, `shouldShowJamCoach`,
    `markJamCoachDone`); flag wired from `StudioShell.jsx`
    (`document.projectMeta.id === 'open-jam'`). Tests in `StudioCoachMarks.test.jsx`.
  - Wiki updated (`wikiContent.js`, `guest-and-sandbox-modes` article).
- Validation (Node 22 via `brew node@22` — this Mac's default Node 25 breaks
  jsdom's localStorage, an env-only issue): lint clean, build passes, 794/794
  tests, wiki check passes.
- Not done: live click-through on staging (owed after the push's deploy
  settles); not promoted to `main`/production — user has only asked for `dev`.

## Last commit

`dev` at `a6f4b20d` — pushed, matches `origin/dev`. Staging deploy
triggered by the push, not yet re-verified live post-deploy. `main` =
prod = `2ad9c016` (verified via `origin/main` + prod health endpoint —
not `f656bc63`). **User explicitly held production** ("no wait no
production") — work stays on dev/staging until they say promote.

## Session (2026-07-19 — live-verified `src/seed/`, found + fixed a real World-nesting bug)

Did the manual live click-through of `/open/seed` that the previous two
sessions had shipped but never actually run (browser extension wasn't
connected until this session). Found the free-nesting/active-marker/code-
panel work all genuinely works as designed — verified by placing all 49
registered node types in one project (zero crashes, zero console errors)
and by diffing raw `parentId` values from `/api/projects/:id/document`
rather than trusting the UI.

That same API-diffing turned up a real bug the UI was actively lying
about: nesting anything **inside** a `universe.world` node — the entire
point of the previous sessions' redesign — silently landed the new node
as a **sibling** of World instead of its child, at any depth. I initially
reported this as working (trusted a UI element that looked like scope
navigation but wasn't); only caught by fetching the live document and
reading `parentId` directly. Root cause: `universe.world` (and every
other `panel-2d`-render type — Text/Image/Browser/stream panels) is
deliberately excluded from the graph canvas's card list, which was the
*only* thing wired to the scope-navigation handler — so there was no
reachable way to enter such a node's own scope at all. Fixed by adding an
`Enter ›` button to `DesktopWindow.jsx`'s per-node window header, wired to
the pre-existing `handleEnterNode` (which already handled `universe.world`
correctly — it just had no caller). Verified live at 1 and 4 levels of
nesting: children now get the correct `parentId` and render in the 3D
viewport (a cube/sphere genuinely appears on the grid). Full writeup:
`docs/ai/known-fixes.md` (last row).

**Separately confirmed and NOT yet fixed**: opening a nested World's live
3D viewport while an ancestor scope's World viewport is also mounted can
trigger `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost.` and freeze the tab's paint
pipeline (data survives — confirmed via reload — only the render/compositor
hangs). Reproduced twice in independent tabs. Likely simultaneous WebGL
context exhaustion (browsers cap concurrent contexts, ~16). Not touched
this session — flagged for whoever picks up World-viewport work next.

Committed `40d96c0d` (code + tests, 4 new tests, 891/891 suite green,
lint clean) + docs commit `a6f4b20d`. Pushed to `origin/dev`.

## Previous session (2026-07-19 — vanity space/project links + a real concurrent-edit incident)

Shipped clean public links: spaces/projects get a `slug` independently
renameable from their immutable id, enabling `/wcc/artistplace`-style short
links alongside the existing `/p/{id}` and `/studio/projects/{id}` forms
(both kept forever, nothing replaced). Server: `spaces.slug`/`projects.slug`
columns, `PATCH` validation (reserved words, 409 on collision), new
`GET /api/resolve/:space/:project`. Client: `getAppLocationState` classifies
the bare two-segment shape, `SlugProjectRoute` resolves it and falls back to
a plain space route on a miss. Admin gets an "Edit public link" action;
`ProjectSwitcher` gets one-click "Copy link". Full proposal (custom domains
and in-app space export still draft-only): `docs/architecture/
SPEC_space_urls_and_portability.md`. Committed `26452eb3`.

**Real incident, now resolved**: this repo runs multiple concurrent Claude
sessions sharing the same on-disk working tree (see `docs/ai/parallel-
agents.md`). Editing `src/RootApp.jsx` landed a stray import from another
session's in-progress, uncommitted `src/seed/` lane — `src/RootApp.jsx` on
disk already had their edits when mine were applied, and the whole file got
committed together, breaking the pushed build (`f7306204` attempted a fix
by stripping the import; that raced with the other session's own fix,
`9c70e534`, which committed the real `src/seed/` files instead — `d908bcd3`
reverted `f7306204` once the actual fix was confirmed). Net effect after
all three commits: both features are intact, correctly wired, and verified
live. **Lesson for next session**: when a shared file was very likely
touched by someone else recently (long-running repo, multiple active
sessions), diff the actual staged change before committing — don't assume
"what's on disk when I `git add` this file" is only your own edit.

## Previous session (2026-07-19 — kill node-type singletons, universal code panel; committed `fe30ea53`, pushed)

The `src/seed/` lane itself (fork of Beta, hierarchy-as-connection active
markers) was committed separately by a concurrent session (`9c70e534`,
after `26452eb3` shipped RootApp's seed import without the untracked
`src/seed/` directory — a real CI-breaking near-miss, now fixed). This
session's own commit (`fe30ea53`) covers the schema/registry/Beta/docs
side of the same work — the two commits together are the full picture.

User wanted free-form node nesting ("build like lego") instead of the
one-per-scope restriction a same-day-earlier session had just added a
warning for. Went through a deep multi-tool research pass (TouchDesigner,
Notch, Kantan Mapper, Houdini, Blender, Nuke, Unreal Blueprints, vvvv,
Cables.gl, Max/MSP, VCV Rack, Resolume, QLab, Ableton, Hydra) before landing
on a concrete plan — full writeup: `/home/nooo/.claude/plans/luminous-bouncing-otter.md`.
Shipped (lint/build/887 tests green throughout):

1. **Removed the singleton system entirely** — `SINGLETON_TYPE_IDS`/
   `SCOPE_SINGLETON_TYPE_IDS`/`getSingletonDedupKey` deleted from both
   `src/shared/projectSchema.js` and `shared/projectSchema.cjs` (not left
   unused — actually gone). Stripped `singleton:true` from the 6 affected
   `nodeRegistry.js` types. Removed Beta's same-day blocked-create warning
   (`getPaletteBlockReason`, `NodePalette.jsx`'s `getBlockReason` prop/CSS).
2. **New lane `src/seed/`** — full fork of `src/beta/` (first lane-forked-
   from-another-lane in the project; see `PROJECT_SURFACES.md`'s "On forking
   a new lane from Beta"), routed at `/open/seed`, wired into `RootApp.jsx`.
   Own localStorage namespace (`dii.seed.*`). Fixed one opportunistic bug
   while forking: edges are now scope-filtered before rendering.
3. **Hierarchy-as-connection active markers** (Kantan Mapper pattern) — new
   generic `workspaceState.activeNodeIdByTypeScope` map (keyed
   `typeId::scopeId`) for World/Light/Background/Grid, alongside the
   pre-existing `liveWorldNodeIdByScope`. Small ● toggle on `seed`'s graph
   node cards. Beta itself keeps its simpler `.find()`-first-match lookup.
4. **Universal code panel** — every node type (not just `node.null`) gets an
   inert "Code" inspector section, `values.__code` (distinct reserved key).
   No execution anywhere — storage/display only, deliberately out of scope.
5. Added `authoringOnly: true` (cosmetic palette tag) to the ~24 node types
   that don't compute/render anything real yet.

Design detail + explicitly-deferred Phase 2 (boundary In/Out nodes, a
closed-outer-panel/custom-parameter side-channel, Studio-as-a-brick, a
separate performance-safe surface): plan file above,
`docs/architecture/RECURSIVE_NODE_CORE.md` ("Nesting"/"The `seed` lane"),
`docs/ai/known-fixes.md` (last row). Committed (`fe30ea53`) and pushed
(`c0d33af5` on top, docs-only). Not yet manually click-verified live
(hit a real routing regression during the first attempt — a concurrent
session's `f7306204` had dropped the seed import from `RootApp.jsx`,
already reverted by `d908bcd3` before this — see "Last commit" above
before assuming that's still broken). Next: push (when asked) + a live
click-through of `/open/seed`.

## Previous session (2026-07-19 — audience/promotion/licensing)

- **License**: repo now AGPL-3.0 (`LICENSE` + package.json
  `"license": "AGPL-3.0-only"`) — makes the landing's "Open source"
  claim true. Direction user-confirmed: open like a library, revenue
  from services around it, never from closing the code.
- **Promotion kit**: `docs/promo/` — PLAN.md (ranked audiences, phased
  rollout), SUSTAINABILITY.md (AGPL code + CC-BY asset commons +
  4 revenue lanes; Blender-fund model verified), drafts/ (Notations #2
  post, Show HN, Three.js forum, Reddit, stakeholder mail template +
  verified festival/grant list). 101-agent deep-research verified the
  festival/funding claims 3-0; community-launch norms did NOT survive
  verification — re-check forum rules manually before posting.
- **Near-term calendar**: EMAP call opens 3 Sep 2026 (deadline 6 Nov);
  Horizon HERITAGE deadline 23 Sep 2026 (needs heritage-institution
  consortium partner); Jan 2027: Prix Ars Electronica + ECHOES call 3;
  FIVARS next cycle = best WebXR fit. Submit works, not the platform.
- Wiki: new "License & openness" article. Golden rule added:
  usage-limit sizing + never-brick checkpoint workflow
  (docs/ai/golden_rules.md, Agent Behavior Rules).
- **Later same session**: pushed to dev + staging live-verified (landing/
  wiki/wcc/beyond-form, zero JS errors); unbricked CI by committing the
  missing `src/seed/` lane (`9c70e534`); golden rule split into two
  (budget sizing vs same-session perk capture, `44d12e1b`); docs IA fix —
  one canonical lane map in README/CURRENT.md/AGENTS.md (`7753699c`);
  new **Producer role** (`docs/ai/roles/producer.md`, `6892b005`) —
  default first hat: classify user messages, park impulsive ideas
  verbatim+translated in `docs/ai/INBOX.md`, never mix into running work.
  Inbox has its first real entry: **sound-in-spaces** (parked). Results
  artifact page published (private) for the user.
- **Owed by user**: 60–90s demo recording; fill warm-contact names in
  drafts/stakeholders.md; approve every outbound post/mail (Notations #2
  draft ready for Jul 20); say when to promote dev → main (license goes
  live on prod only then).
- **Nothing was posted or mailed. Production untouched.**

## Previous session (2026-07-18 — Studio wrong-space bug fix + hardening batch 1+2)

- Real user-reported bug: opening a project in Studio via a direct/
  bookmarked link (no space segment in the URL, e.g. from admin's
  "Open in Studio") silently landed in the `main` space instead of the
  project's real space — everything but the project document itself
  (assets, publish state, back-to-hub link) was wrong. Root cause:
  `getStudioLocationState` (`src/studio/utils/studioRouting.js`)
  hardcoded `spaceId: defaultSpaceId` for space-less URLs instead of
  leaving it unset, pre-empting `StudioEditor`'s own fallback to
  `document.projectMeta.spaceId`. Fixed + admin's two "Open in Studio"
  buttons (`AdminManageSection.jsx`) switched from an async `space`
  lookup (`space?.id`, could resolve null/stale) to `project.spaceId`
  (DB-sourced, travels with the project row). Regression tests added;
  known-fixes.md updated. Pushed to `dev`, staging verified.
- User then asked for a "full audit + hardening plan" covering this bug
  class, general security, and AI-agent stale-fact citation (caught the
  agent citing an old cPanel deploy workflow and a wrong Ollama model
  name in the same session). Planned via EnterPlanMode, approved, shipped
  in two batches (not yet pushed — local commits `1a56e9a7`, `e374d70f`):
  - **Batch 1**: `config.js` now hard-fails boot in production if
    `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` falls back to an API token instead of only
    warning; CI + Dependabot gained `npm audit` coverage (root +
    serverXR); new `scripts/check-fallback-patterns.mjs` (CI-gated)
    greps `serverXR/src` for the "silent hardcoded fallback" bug-class
    shape; `known-fixes.md` got a bug-class header naming all 4 known
    instances; `golden_rules.md`/`agent-operating-contract.md` gained a
    "verify infra/deploy/tool facts before citing" rule.
  - **Batch 2**: new `fallbackContracts.test.js` (server-side analog of
    the spaceId bug, wired into `test:server-contracts`) +
    `authAccess.test.js` cases locking in null/undefined-spaces-means-
    unrestricted semantics; `docs:ai:check`'s rot-scan extended to
    `docs/deploy/*.md` for stale legacy-workflow-name citations — running
    it for real found and fixed two genuinely stale citations beyond the
    known allowlist candidates (`.claude/agents/infra.md` still called
    the cPanel workflow "Current deploy"; `deploy/AGENTS.md` still
    described the VPS path as unconfigured/additive when it's been live
    primary since 2026-07-15).
  - User's own global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (outside this repo) also had
    the same stale cPanel deploy claim — fixed on request.
  - Full plan: `/home/nooo/.claude/plans/stateless-greeting-bengio.md`.
    Deferred items (not started): recover/re-list the ~23 untriaged audit
    findings, decide whether to test-gate `deploy-space-code.yml`, rotate
    the stale GitHub App key, a speculative periodic memory-self-audit.

### Previous sessions (compressed — see PROGRESS.md for full detail)

- **2026-07-17 cont'd**: landing "Enter Space" reuses the existing "Main"
  space concept (`defaultSpaceId`) rather than a new config field; a real
  Walk/Fly UX bug fixed (mislabeled exit button, not a broken mechanism);
  "Made with di.iiii" badge restyled to work on any theme.
- **2026-07-17, perf audit**: 12 fixes (build chunking, code-splitting,
  caching, query paths, render loops) shipped to prod; two live bugs found
  during manual verification and fixed (`/data/spaces` root-owned →
  EACCES, and a pre-existing mouse-look bug from a stale `playerRef`
  reassignment, `git log -L`-blamed to commit `a79c689c`).
- **2026-07-17, multi-world graphs**: `world.light`/`background`/`grid`/
  `universe.world` moved to per-scope dedup, `BetaViewport.jsx` scoped
  rendering, `workspaceState.liveWorldNodeIdByScope` live-pointer + "●"
  toggle, Studio's read-only `StudioWorldSurface.jsx` render pane
  (dev-only "W" split) — this is the multi-world/singleton system this
  session's node-graph rework builds on top of and then removes.
- **2026-07-17, Beta audit → Studio graph pane**: fixed a window-clipping
  CSS bug, extracted the node-graph engine into `src/project/graph/`,
  added Studio's first read-only graph pane (dev-only "N" split), fixed a
  Node-0-deletion safety bug.
- **2026-07-16, full repo audit**: fixed path-traversal/auth-scope bug in
  `syncRoutes.js`, a lost-update race on concurrent doc writes, confirmed
  nightly VPS backups already existed. ~23 lower findings still open, see
  `docs/ai/known-fixes.md`.
- **Earlier**: deploy pipeline made real (staging+prod on VPS/Docker/Caddy),
  OAuth sign-in bug fixed (state signed per-request, not once at startup).

## What works

- Studio (six desktop panels — Create/Scene/World/Share/Code/Projects — five on the mobile nav, + phone layout + visual help), Beta, WCC, viewer
- Auth (session-cookie, roles, OAuth-first, CSRF-protected) + open-space/sandbox grants
- Production + staging both live on VPS, deploy via `git push origin main`/`dev`
- Nightly VPS backups + validated restore path
- Studio dev-only panes: read-only node-graph ("N" split) and live-world 3D ("W" split)
- `src/seed/` (dev-only, `/open/seed`): free-form node nesting (all 49
  node types verified live, no crashes), active markers for
  World/Light/Background/Grid, universal code panel, and now (`40d96c0d`,
  not pushed) actually entering a World/panel-2d node's own scope to place
  real children — verified live at 1 and 4 nesting levels.
- Vanity space/project links (`/wcc/artistplace`-style) — pushed, backend
  flow manually smoke-tested end-to-end (create/patch/collision/resolve),
  not yet click-verified through the actual admin UI in a live browser.

## Open

- World-nesting scope-entry fix (`40d96c0d`) pushed — owed: re-verify live
  on staging post-deploy.
- Nested-World WebGL context-loss/tab-freeze bug (see session entry above)
  — reproduced twice, not yet fixed. Likely simultaneous-context exhaustion
  from multiple live 3D viewports mounted at once.
- vanity links: pushed and building clean, still no manual live click-
  through through the actual admin UI.
- Hardening plan deferred items: recover/re-list the ~23 untriaged
  findings below, decide on test-gating `deploy-space-code.yml`, rotate
  the stale GitHub App key, a speculative periodic memory-self-audit.
- Custom domains + in-app space export (`SPEC_space_urls_and_portability.md`
  items 3c/3d) — plan-only, not started, 3c needs product-owner sign-off
  before any code (new infra: Caddy/DNS).
- Promote Enter Space/Main-space reuse + Walk/Fly label fix + badge
  restyle to `main` when the user is ready — not yet asked for.
- License/promo work (see previous-session entry above) — owed by user:
  demo recording, warm-contact names, approve every outbound post/mail
  (Notations #2 draft ready for Jul 20). On staging; prod promotion held
  by user.
- `docs/ai/INBOX.md`: **sound-in-spaces** parked (XRC→VPE, size M/L) —
  review at next session start via the Producer protocol.
- No published staging space currently exercises the generic Walk/Fly
  button (all are custom experiences) — if that regression test class
  matters going forward, consider publishing one plain `entryView:
  'scene'` demo project.
- ~23 lower-priority audit findings untriaged — `docs/ai/known-fixes.md`.
- Studio dev-only panes need a product decision before leaving dev-only:
  inspector wiring, flag rollout audience, Beta-vs-Studio long-term shape.
  `seed` lane raises the same question one level up — see
  `docs/architecture/PROJECT_SURFACES.md`'s "On forking a new lane".
- Off-box backup copy still missing (VPS-local only).
- `main`'s branch protection still bypassed by admin-override direct pushes.
- Brand: canonical domain/handle undecided; `/privacy` not wired into routes.
- Real-device click-through owed: guest journey + invite flow.
- Drive Picker blocked on Cloud console. Stale GitHub App key in `serverXR/.env.local`.
