# place — footage of a hall in, a room you can walk out

One command turns a folder of photographs and video of a venue into a space on
di.iiii: the hall standing still on its floor, at the right size, with a door
you arrive at, and the footage it was built from kept beside it.

Why it works this way, and what the pipeline is for:
[`docs/architecture/PLACE.md`](../../docs/architecture/PLACE.md).

## The one command

```bash
node scripts/place/place.mjs \
    --from /mnt/data/footage/moxir-2026-10-17 \
    --name moxir \
    --scale-edge 24
```

`--scale-edge 24` is the only thing the machine cannot work out: **measure one
wall of the hall with a tape and type the number.** Without it, use
`--door-guess` and the pipeline calls the tallest doorway 2.1 m — and says, in
every place it can, that the size is a GUESS.

It takes about an hour, nearly all of it the reconstruction. When it finishes
it prints the addresses to walk.

## Before the first run

**Colab must be signed in**, once, by a person with a browser:

```bash
colab sessions        # follow the link it prints, paste the code back
```

If the CLI errors on `KernelClient`, reinstall it — version 1.0.2 of
`jupyter-kernel-client` renamed that class:

```bash
uv tool install --force google-colab-cli --with 'jupyter-kernel-client<1'
```

**Python with opencv, numpy and trimesh.** The pipeline finds it by itself if
`python3` has them; otherwise name one:

```bash
PLACE_PYTHON=/home/dob/tools/ComfyUI/.venv/bin/python node scripts/place/place.mjs …
```

**Blender** is used to read the OBJ Meshroom returns. **ffmpeg** pulls frames
out of video. Both are expected on the PATH.

**A di.iiii to import into.** The default is the local one at
`https://local.thedi.studio/serverXR`; `--api` points somewhere else. The API
token is read from `DI_API_TOKEN`, from `--token-file <env file>`, or from
`~/.di/di.env` / `serverXR/.env.local`. It is never printed.

## The five steps, on their own

Every step writes into one working folder and can be run again by itself. Use
`--from-step <n>` to carry on from where it stopped.

```bash
# 1 — footage in, usable frames out
node scripts/place/frames.mjs --from <footage> --work <work>

# 2 — frames to a rented GPU, mesh back
node scripts/place/colab-job.mjs --work <work> --gpu L4
node scripts/place/colab-job.mjs --work <work> --dry-run         # just the commands
node scripts/place/colab-job.mjs --work <work> --local-obj a.obj # no GPU at all

# 3 — a reconstruction is not a model
node scripts/place/crush.mjs --work <work>

# 4 — floor flat, a metre a metre
node scripts/place/fit.mjs --work <work> --scale-edge 24
node scripts/place/fit.mjs --work <work> --door-guess --flip

# 5 — the room arrives on di.iiii
node scripts/place/import.mjs --work <work> --name moxir
```

What ends up in the working folder:

| file | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `images/` | the frames the reconstruction actually used |
| `frames.json` | how many were kept, how many thrown out, and why |
| `mesh/` | what came back from the GPU: the OBJ and its textures |
| `raw.glb` | that mesh, converted, before any crushing |
| `place.glb` | crushed: ≤ 300k triangles, WebP textures, meshopt |
| `crush-before.png` · `crush-after.png` | **open these** — the crushing, looked at |
| `place.json` | the fit: size, transform, spawn, walkable floor, and how the size was decided |
| `place-fitted.glb` | the room as it ships, standing upright on its own floor |
| `import.json` | where it went and the addresses to walk |

## No footage yet? Make a hall

```bash
blender -b -P scripts/place/testroom.py -- /tmp/place/testroom.obj
node scripts/place/place.mjs --from /tmp/place --name place-test \
    --local-obj /tmp/place/testroom.obj --scale-edge 8.3 --edge width --from-step 2
```

A room 8 × 6 m and 3 m high with a 2.1 m doorway, a column, a stage and a
table, at about 400k triangles — then tilted, spun and scaled to nothing like
life size, which is the mess the fitter exists to undo.

## Things that have already gone wrong

- **A rented GPU left running bills until somebody notices.** Any failure
  inside the job releases it, and so does Ctrl-C. If a run is interrupted some
  other way: `colab stop -s place-<name>`, and `colab sessions` lists what is
  up.
- **The frames go up in 16 MB pieces.** `colab upload` carries the file
  base64'd inside one JSON body; a hall's worth of photographs answers 500 and
  keeps nothing.
- **Meshroom is an 8 GB download** onto the box before an hour of GPU —
  measured at 7.3 GB after 40 minutes on Colab, around 3 MB/s, during which `wget -q` prints nothing
  and the log holds one line. The job runs detached and touches a heartbeat
  file every 15 seconds, so silence is not mistaken for death. (Worth doing
  one day: keep the tarball on Drive and mount it instead.)
- **Colab's kernel websocket wedges.** A poll was seen hanging for twelve
  minutes while the reconstruction carried on beside it. Polls give up after
  four minutes and ask again; the job never notices.
- **A phone's HEVC clip is limited-range yuv420p** and ffmpeg 9's JPEG encoder
  refuses it, which silently loses the whole video. The extraction names
  `-pix_fmt yuvj420p`, and falls back to PNG.
- **Headless Chrome gets SwiftShader, never the NVIDIA card.** The preview
  renders are software-rendered on purpose, and they are slow — a 300k
  triangle room can take a minute to paint.
- **The local tier is the owner's live install.** Import into a NEW space;
  never point this at one that already holds work.

## Unverified

The Meshroom invocation in `reconstruct.py` is written from the 2025.1.0
documentation. The rest of the Colab step — sign-in, session, chunked upload,
detached start, polling, download, stop — has been run against a real box.
