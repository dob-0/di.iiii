## 2026-08-08 — Raw as a workspace: the plan, and the first node in it

Wrote `docs/architecture/RAW_WORKSPACE.md` and built the keeper node it names as
step one.

**The plan, read out of the code rather than the roadmaps.** Three findings
changed its shape:

- Nodes are already windows. Nine panel components exist plus `DesktopWindow`,
  and Studio is itself a node. "Nodes are windows, windows are small apps" is
  the existing architecture, not a proposal.
- The runtime ceiling recorded in `reference-raw-node-runtime-truth` (2026-08-06:
  no stream output ever carries data) is **out of date**. `nodeGraphRuntime.js`
  reads `context.liveOutputs`, a `Map` keyed `nodeId:portId` that panels write
  into; webcam frames and mic readings already flow through it. That seam is
  what the whole plan hangs off.
- `stream.*` and `device.osc.*` are gated because they are **not implementable in
  a page** — NDI and OSC are UDP/LAN — not because nobody got to them. So the
  workspace needs a local process, and `di` is the obvious host. Raised with the
  session designing `di` phase 2 rather than designing a second daemon.

The owner chose the hybrid shape (local *and* online, connect when needed), and
asked whether this could cover a festival toolkit. §7 answers that: the palette
is already a portrait of the Notations #2 rig, `source.realsense.d405` exists
because a D405 was used — and the keeper, which was that show's **main**
installation layer, had no node type at all. That is what this branch fixes.

**`agent.keeper`.** Endpoint-shaped, not account-shaped: you name a URL and a
model, so nothing runs as anyone and no credential is held. That side-steps the
open "agent authority" question entirely, and it is the only shape that works in
a room with no internet. One request body reaches both Ollama and any
OpenAI-compatible server; only the reply differs. Reasoning models' `<think>`
blocks are stripped and a truncated answer says so, both carried over from what
the rite hit live. `reply` and `busy` are real ports.

Set up in the window itself, not only the inspector — a node the palette can
place has to be usable where it lands.

**Two bugs found by looking at it in the real editor**, neither visible to unit
tests, both now in `known-fixes.md`:

- The panel sat on "Asking…" for ever while the request had actually succeeded.
  `RawEditor` passes its callbacks as inline arrows, so the unmount effect that
  listed one as a dependency re-ran on every parent render and aborted the live
  request. Any panel using the `liveOutputs` channel is exposed to this.
- The panel overflowed its own window by exactly its padding, clipping the reply
  on a phone. `raw.css` sets `box-sizing` per rule, not globally.

Verified end to end against a stub model box at 1440×900 DPR 2 and 390×844 DPR 3
— placed from the palette, configured, asked, answered, `<think>` stripped, and
looked at in both.

**Not done, deliberately:** no streaming responses (one reply per ask), no
conversation history, and no bridge — MIDI is the next step and the cheapest
proof of that contract.
