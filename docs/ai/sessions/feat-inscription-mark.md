## 2026-08-06 — Open inscriptions can carry the drawing that was made for them

A crossing of br_id_ge left a name and a word, and the form it wore in the field
was a torus knot picked by a hash of its own id — unique, permanent, and nobody's.
Nothing a visitor actually authored survived.

- The rite now quantizes the line a hand drew into an opaque `m1.<base64url>`
  token (~1KB) and sends it with the crossing. `POST /inscriptions` takes an
  optional `mark`; `PUT /inscriptions/:id/mark` replaces it afterwards with the
  same one-time proof that unmakes a crossing — needed because the ending is a
  page you can draw on again, long after the crossing was posted.
- The server validates by shape and never parses it: a malformed or oversized
  mark is dropped and the crossing still succeeds, because a drawing is not
  worth failing a crossing over.
- Added the new route to `PUBLIC_CORS_ROUTES` beside its DELETE sibling,
  verified with a real preflight from a foreign origin (a rite running on a
  mirror or an installation laptop is cross-origin to the field).
- The wiki entry still said "update and delete are impossible on this path",
  which the proof-gated DELETE had already made untrue — corrected alongside
  documenting the new mark field.
- `.env.example` never mentioned `MESH_ROOM_SECRET`/`MESH_PROTECTED_NODE_PREFIXES`
  even though both compose files have passed them since the mesh identity gate
  landed — the only way to learn the keeper could be protected was reading
  `meshHub.js`. Found because it stayed unprotected on prod: `node=keeper-anything`
  was able to join the live relay on 2026-08-06. Documented what an empty value
  means, since empty is the dangerous state and looks identical from outside
  until someone claims the id.
