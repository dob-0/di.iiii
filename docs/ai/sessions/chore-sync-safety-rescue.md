## 2026-08-06 — Sync-safety pass: rescue, seal, and the structural fix

Full plan at `~/.claude/plans/humming-wiggling-wozniak.md` (not tracked in-repo). Built
on PR #94's `repo-state.mjs` tooling rather than duplicating it.

- Recovered three sessions' `CURRENT.md` notes that a concurrent rewrite had silently
  destroyed before their branch merged (found via `git fsck --dangling`) — folded into
  `PROGRESS.md`. Re-opened one still-genuinely-undone TODO that was lost with them (the
  Open Space scene zip, never imported).
- Rescued 263 uncommitted lines sitting in a `/tmp` worktree with no backup → pushed as
  `fix/inscription-mark-server`. Pushed two branches that existed only on this disk
  (`feat/timeline-core` had no upstream at all; `feat/raw-studio-node` was mistargeting
  `origin/dev`, so a bare push from it would have landed straight on `dev`).
- Built and verified a guard (`checkSafeSource` in `space-sync-vendor.mjs`) against the
  8-copies-of-the-vendoring-tool hazard — confirmed live, not theoretical: triggered the
  real downgrade once while testing the unguarded old copy, fixed it, then verified the
  guarded version refuses the same operation. Added `--release` (write + bump
  `minEngine` + commit + push per linked repo in one command) — not run for real yet,
  waiting on this branch merging so a real `dev` checkout can run it.
- Worktrees 21 → 10 (removed 8 confirmed merged/stale, one of which turned out to hide
  a third lost session), local branches 55 → 17 (deleted 38 confirmed fully-merged or
  patch-equivalent — 2 looked like garbage by branch name but had real unmerged work,
  caught by checking each individually rather than trusting the heuristic).
- This session-notes protocol itself (`docs/ai/sessions/`, `docs:ai:check` enforcement,
  the `active_branch: dev` literal check) is the structural fix for the one *confirmed*
  loss mechanism — everything above was rescue/cleanup around the edges of it.

## 2026-08-06 — `npm run land`, `repo-state.mjs` live-process detection

- `repo-state.mjs`/`repo-state-lib.mjs` (extends PR #94, doesn't duplicate it):
  `classifyWorktree` (LIVE > UNPUSHED > UNMERGED > STALE > GONE, via `/proc` scan +
  `git cherry` for squash-merge-aware merge detection), `--brief`/`--sweep`/`--json`.
  Real bug caught building this: the first live-process pattern matched `vitest run`
  (one-shot), so a test run in progress got misidentified as a live dev server —
  happened for real, not hypothetical, fixed and regression-tested.
- `session-land.mjs`/`session-land-lib.mjs` (`npm run land`): folds `docs/ai/sessions/`
  notes into `PROGRESS.md`, rewrites `CURRENT.md`'s Last-session to a title list
  pointing there (full prose never goes in CURRENT.md — the only way to guarantee the
  50-line budget regardless of how much landed in one batch), deletes the notes, runs
  the worktree sweep, commits (not pushes). Verified end-to-end in an isolated clone
  with two fake notes — folding, CURRENT.md rewrite, file deletion, sweep, commit all
  confirmed correct.
- Second real bug caught testing `land`: `execFileSync`'s default stderr inheritance
  leaked "fatal: no upstream configured" straight to the console for an expected,
  already-handled failure (probing an unpushed branch) — in both `repo-state.mjs` and
  `space-sync-vendor.mjs`'s `git()` helpers, pre-existing in PR #94's code, not just
  this branch's additions. Fixed both.
- Dogfooded the CURRENT.md-untouched rule on this exact branch: my own earlier commits
  had hand-edited `CURRENT.md` directly, in violation of the rule being written.
  Reverted rather than grandfathered — see the commit for the full story, including a
  second bug this surfaced (`origin/dev...HEAD` vs `origin/dev` diff form).
- `.claude/commands/land.md` added; `recap.md` (from PR #94) rewritten to write session
  notes instead of editing `CURRENT.md` directly, which is now a `docs:ai:check`
  violation. `docs/ai/golden_rules.md` and `docs/ai/parallel-agents.md` updated to
  match — the worktree-location convention (`.claude/worktrees/`, not `../di.iiii-*`)
  is now stated as the rule, not "either is fine".

## 2026-08-06 — Vendor drift gets a check that can actually fail

- `scripts/space-sync-selfcheck.mjs` (vendored as `sync-space-check.mjs`): fetches
  di.iiii's real upstream engine over HTTPS (public repo, no token), byte-compares,
  asserts `minEngine` matches. Never skips on a fetch failure — that was the exact flaw
  in the tool it replaces. Live-tested against br_id_ge's real current state: correctly
  caught the actual `minEngine: 5` vs vendored `v6` drift that's been sitting there all
  session, plus byte-mismatch and missing-file failure modes, all verified for real.
- `docs/templates/vendor-check.yml`: the CI workflow that runs it, in the LINKED repo's
  own CI (di.iiii's CI structurally can't see a linked repo's copy — that inversion is
  the actual fix). `--release` now writes both alongside the engine.
- Second real dry-run bug, same shape as `land`'s: `--release --dry-run` was calling the
  new file-writer unconditionally before checking the flag, so a "preview" silently
  wrote files to disk. Caught by actually running it against a scratch directory, not
  by inspection. Fixed, regression-tested (3 cases: dry-run writes nothing, a real run
  writes everything, a second real run is idempotent).
- `space-sync.test.js`: di.iiii's own spaces' `minEngine` now asserted strictly equal
  to `ENGINE_VERSION` (was `<=`) — these are declared in the same repo as the engine,
  no excuse for lagging the way a linked repo briefly can.
- `docs/ai/space-sync-vendoring.md` added (full reference); `golden_rules.md`'s
  vendoring rule updated to `npm run space:sync:release` and a new rule on why a
  checked-out worktree is a runnable copy of every tool, not just source code.

## 2026-08-06 — The real fix, landed for real, in all 3 linked repos

- `br_id_ge`: `minEngine` 5→6, engine v6 committed, `sync-space-check.mjs` +
  `vendor-check.yml` added, `sync-space.yml` gated on it. Pushed to `main`. **Both the
  new vendor-check AND the existing production sync workflow ran and passed for
  real on GitHub Actions** — content unchanged, tooling only, verified green.
- `beyond_form`: same fix, plus `di-space.space.json` committed for the first time
  (was untracked since the repo was linked — no history at all until this commit).
  Pushed. **This repo's first CI run ever, passed.**
- `platform_recordar`: same fix, committed. No remote — this repo's permanent state,
  documented in a new `AGENTS.md` (had none) as a deliberate `KNOWN_EXCEPTIONS` entry
  rather than a silent gap.
- Each repo's own pre-existing uncommitted work (br_id_ge's real session notes in
  `CURRENT.md`; a `DEFAULT_LIVE_URL`-removal edit in both `beyond_form` and
  `platform_recordar`'s `di-space.json`) deliberately left untouched and unstaged —
  not mine, not this task's scope.

- `~/di-spaces` investigated: a genuinely separate system (nightly pull-based backup +
  guarded disaster-restore, `--force-prod` required for a prod write), not an
  unexamined duplicate of the editing path — it already documents the boundary in its
  own README. Cross-referenced from `docs/ai/space-sync-vendoring.md` so the boundary
  is visible from both sides, no code changes needed.

**Plan complete** except: consolidating to one canonical di.iiii checkout, blocked on
`di.iiii-algomerge`'s active work (check `npm run state` before attempting it), and the
human-triage branch list from the P0/P1 worktree cleanup (`fix/audit-gaps`,
`feat/inscription-mark` — overlaps `fix/inscription-mark-server`, `fix/space-sync-engine`,
`fix/wcc-degenerate-lock-deltas`, `feat/raw-studio-node`, `feat/timeline-core`,
`chore/github-oauth-env-wiring`'s 4 real unmerged walker fixes, `feat/algovrithm`'s 1
unmerged hook-path fix) — land, park, or drop, one call each, not this session's to make.
